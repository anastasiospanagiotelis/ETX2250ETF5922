# Why does ethical practice matter?

- Legal responsibility 
--

- Institutional requirements
--

- Moral &amp; Social responsibility 
--
---

# How to consider 

- Not about following a series of rules
--

- About having a discussion about risk, risk mitigation and benefits
--

- Not a single decision, but ongoing conversation
--
---

# Things to consider

- Data collection
--

- Data storage
--

- Analysis
--

- Communication
--

- Deployment
--

# Data collection

---

# Data collection

- Often something that happens before data scientist/statisticians are involved in the project
--

- Can determine the structure and nature of the data we recieve
--
---

# Informed consent
- Do participants understand how the data will be used?
--

- Are participants capable of giving consent (e.g., children)
--

- Is there coersion? 
--

- Do participants understand the risks?
--

- What happens to any incentive if participants drop out halfway through
  
---

# Collection bias
- Who has the potential to be represented in the data?
--

-  How was the data collected?
--

- What are the limitations in the data collection method?
--

- Will the collection method limit generalization?

---

# Limit exposure
- Only collect the data you need

--
- Do you need to collect contact information? 
  + What happens if you need to contact someone (e.g., test results)

--
- If you do collect personal information, does it need to be linked to the rest of the data? 

---

# Data storage

---

# Data security

- Often determined by the data stakeholders (generally who collects the data, but not always)
--

- If you didn't collect the data, and haven't been told how to store it, ask whoever gave it you
--

- As a general rule, if you don't have permission to share someone else's data, don't.
--

---

# Data storage

- Try not to store even public data on sites like Github. 
  + Public, freely available data often require consent/agreement to particular stewardship practices
  + Instead provide directions on how to download, and when you downloaded
--

- If data is sent to you with a type of procedure, use this encryption as a default for all data transfer in future
  + for example encrypted zip file with password sent via text
  
---

# Right to be forgotten

- General Data Protection Regulation in 2014 added a section on the right to be forgotten. Under this, any EU citizen has the right to request that personal data be removed. For more see here https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-to-be-forgotten/.

---

# Data retention plan

- Is there a plan to archive the data for replication of results? How will you ensure that the meaning of the data and any idiosyncracies be recorded?
--

- How will you protect the security of the data in the future? Who will be responsible? Do you have a plan for changing archival procedures as technology changes (e.g., storing on floppy disks)

---

# Data retention plan

- Will data be deleted after a certain period of time? If so, who is responsible for doing that? Who confirms that it has been completed adequately?
--

- Will the data be kept for future analyses? Did the individuals consent to this analysis? How will permission be granted?

# Data fairness

---

# Data

- Sampling bias
(where your sample doesn't represent the population you're interested in)
--

- Selective labels
(where there is more measurement error for some parts of your sample than others)
--

- Systematic Error
(when societal differences can make the conclusions you draw from data)

---

# Model

- Modelling choices and justification
--

- Interpretability
--

- Evaluation 

---

# Communication

- Do the analyses, summaries and visualizations accurately reflect the data?
--

- Are the results reported with reflection on limitations of the data and analysis?
--

- Does the data/model/assumptions justify the generalizations made with the data?
--

- Have we provided our results with sufficient detail to communicate the decisions made in conducting the analysis (reproducibility?)
--

- Have we sought feedback from relevant members of the communities which our results are likely to effect?

---
class: inverse, center, middle
# Deployment

---

# Deployment 

- Do you have a plan for halting the use of your model once it is in production?
--

- For models that will be updated - do we have a plan to evaluate whether the algorithm will become less fair?
--

- For models that will not be updated - do we clearly state when the results generalize to or have a plan for identifying when the results no longer change (e.g., due to society changing?)
