Three fingers.<br> Nice!<br> - Nice throw, kiddo!<br> - Go.<br> Hey, you guys want mayo<br> or mustard, or both?<br> Who wants mayo on a hotdog?<br> Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!<br> Thanks, momma.<br> Got it.<br> Nate, mayo or mustard?<br> I want ketchup.<br> Mind your elbow...<br> Good job, Hawkeye!<br> Go get your arrow.<br> Hey, guys. Enough practice.<br> Soup's on.<br> All right. We're coming.<br> We're hungry.<br> Lila, let's go.<br> Lila?<br> Honey?<br> Babe?<br> Babe?<br> Babe?<br> Boys!<br> Boys?<br> Laura!<br> You don't need to do that,<br> because you're just<br> holding the position.<br> Come on.<br> That was close.<br> That's a goal. We're<br> now one a-piece.<br> I would like to try again.<br> We're tied up.<br> Feel the tension? It's fun.<br> That was terrible. Now you<br> have a chance to win.<br> And you won. Congratulations.<br> Fair game.<br> Good sport.<br> You had fun?<br> It was fun.<br> This thing on?<br> Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.<br> If you find this recording...<br> don't post it, on social media.<br> It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.<br> I don't know if you're<br> ever gonna see these.<br> I don't even know<br> if you're still...<br> Oh, God. I hope so...<br> Today is day 21... uh, 22.<br> You know, if it wasn't for<br> the existensial terror of<br> staring into the<br> literal void of space,<br> I'd say, I'm feeling<br> more better today.<br> The infection's run its course,<br> thanks to the blue meanie back there.<br> You'd love her. Very practical.<br> Only a tiny bit sadistic.<br> Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but<br> we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge<br> to buy ourselves, about,<br> 48 hours of playtime.<br> But it's now dead in the water.<br> We're 1,000 lightyears<br> from the nearest 7-11.<br> Oxygen will run out<br> tomorrow morning.<br> That'll be it.<br> And Pep, I...<br> I know I said no<br> more surprises, but<br> I gotta say I was really hoping<br> to pull off one last one.<br> But it looks like...<br> Well, you know what<br> it looks like.<br> Don't feel bad about this.<br> I mean actually if you<br> grovel for a couple weeks,<br> and then, move on<br> with enormous guilt.<br> I should probably lie down.<br> I'm gonna caress my<br> Please know that...<br> When I drift off, it will be<br> goodbye the whole time...<br> I'll think about you.<br> Because it's always you.<br> - Couldn't stop him.<br> - Neither could I.<br> I lost the kid.<br> Tony, we lost.<br> Is, umm...<br> Oh, my God!<br> It's okay.<br> It's been 23 days since<br> Thanos came to Earth.<br> World governments are in pieces.<br> The parts that are still working<br> are trying to take a census,<br> And it looks like he did...<br> He did exactly what he said he<br> was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..<br> ...fifty percent of<br> all living creatures.<br> Where is he now? Where?<br> We don't know.<br> He just opened a portal<br> and walked through.<br> What's wrong with him?<br> He's pissed.<br> He thinks he failed.<br> Which of course he did, but there's a<br> lot of that goin' around, ain't there?<br> Honestly, at this exact second, I<br> thought you were a Build-A-Bear.<br> Maybe I am.<br> We've been hunting Thanos<br> for three weeks now.<br> Deep space scans, and<br> satellites, and we got nothing.<br> - Tony you fought him.<br> - Who told you that?<br> Didn't fight him.<br> No. He wiped my face<br> with a planet while a<br> Bleecker Street magician<br> gave away the stone.<br> - That's what happened. There was no fight...<br> - Okay.<br> Did he give you any clues?<br> Any coordinates, anything?<br> Pfft!<br> I saw this coming a few years back. I had<br> a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.<br> Thought I was dreaming.<br> - Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.<br> - And I needed you.<br> As in past tense. That trumps what<br> you need. It's too late, buddy.<br> Sorry.<br> You know what I need?<br> I need to shave.<br> - And I believe I rememeber telling<br> - Tony, Tony, Tony...<br> why that otherwise,<br> that what we needed was a suit of armor<br> around the world. Remember that?<br> Whether it impacted our precious<br> freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.<br> - Well that didn't work out, did it?<br> - I said we'd lose.<br> You said, "We'll do<br> that together, too."<br> Well guess what, Cap? We lost.<br> You weren't there.<br> But that's what we do, right?<br> Our best work after the fact?<br> We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?<br> Not the Prevengers?<br> Okay. You made your point.<br> Just sit down, okay?<br> - No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.<br> - Tony, sit, sit down!<br> We need you. You're new blood.<br> Bunch of tired old mills...<br> I got nothing for you, Cap.<br> I got no coordinates,<br> no clues, no strategies,<br> no options...<br> Zero. Zip. Nada. No<br> trust, you liar...<br> Here, take this. You find<br> him and you put that on.<br> You hide.<br> - Tony!<br> - I'm fine. I...<br> Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna<br> probably be out for the rest of the day.<br> You guys take care of him. And I'll bring<br> an Bezurian elixir when I come back.<br> - Where are you going?<br> - To kill Thanos.<br> Hey.<br> You know we usually work<br> as a team here, and<br> between you and I we're<br> also a little fragile.<br> We realize up there is more your<br> territory but this is our fight, too.<br> - You even know where he is?<br> - I know people who might.<br> Don't bother.<br> I can tell you where Thanos is.<br> Thanos spent a long time<br> trying to perfect me.<br> Then when he worked, he<br> talked about his great plan.<br> Even disassembled, I<br> wanted to please him.<br> I'd ask, where would we go<br> once his plan was complete?<br> His answer was always the same.<br> To The Garden.<br> That's cute. Thanos has<br> a retirement plan.<br> So where is he, then?<br> When Thanos snapped his fingers,<br> Earth became ground zero for a power surge<br> of ridiculously cosmic proportions.<br> No one's ever seen anything like it...<br> until two days ago.<br> On this planet.<br> Thanos is there.<br> He used the stones again.<br> Hey, hey, hey...<br> We'd be going in<br> short-handed, you know?<br> - Look, he still got the stones, so...<br> - So let's get him.<br> - We use them to bring everyone back.<br> - Just like that?<br> Yeah. Just like that.<br> Even if there's a small chance<br> that we can undo this...<br> I mean, we owe it to everyone<br> who's not in this room to try.<br> If we do this, how do we know it's gonna<br> end any differently than it did before?<br> Because before, you<br> didn't have me.<br> Hey, new girl, everybody in this<br> room is about that superhero life.<br> And if you don't mind my asking, where<br> the hell have you been all this time?<br> There are a lot of other<br> planets in the universe.<br> And unfortunately, they<br> didn't have you guys.<br> I like this one.<br> Let's go get this<br> son of a bitch.<br> Okay. Who here hasn't<br> been to space?<br> You better not throw<br> up on my ship.<br> Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.<br> I'll head down for recon.<br> - This is gonna work Steve.<br> - I know it will.<br> Because I don't know what<br> I'm gonna do if it doesn't.<br> No satellites, no ships, no armies,<br> no ground defenses of any kind.<br> It's just him.<br> Then that's enough.<br> Oh, no.<br> Where are they?<br> Answer the question.<br> The universe<br> required correction.<br> After that, the stones served<br> no purpose, beyond temptation.<br> You murdered trillions!<br> You should be grateful.<br> - Where are the stones?<br> - Gone.<br> - Reduced to atoms.<br> - You used them two days ago.<br> I used the stones to<br> destroy the stones.<br> It nearly killed me.<br> But the work is done.<br> It always will be.<br> I am inevitable.<br> We have to tear this place apart.<br> He has to be lying.<br> My father is many things.<br> A liar is not one of them.<br> Thank you, Daughter.<br> Perhaps I treated<br> you too harshly...<br> What... what did you do?<br> I went for the head.<br> So I, uh...<br> Went on a date the other day.<br> It's the first time in five years,<br> you know? Sit there, dinner...<br> I didn't know what<br> to talk about.<br> What did you talk about?<br> Same old crap, you know? How<br> things have changed, and...<br> My job, his job....<br> How much we miss the Mets.<br> Then things get quiet..<br> He cried as they were<br> serving the salads.<br> What about you?<br> I cried just before dessert.<br> But I'm seeing him<br> again tomorrow, so...<br> That's great.<br> You did the hardest part.<br> You took the jump, you<br> didn't know where you<br> were gonna come down.<br> And that's it. That's those little<br> brave baby steps you gotta take.<br> To try and become whole again.<br> To try and find purpose.<br> I went in the ice in '45 right<br> after I met the love of my life.<br> Woke up 70 years later.<br> You got to move on.<br> Got to move on.<br> The world is in our hands.<br> It's left to us guys.<br> And we got to do<br> something with it.<br> Otherwise...<br> Thanos should've<br> killed all of us.<br> What the hell?<br> Hope?<br> Kid! Hey, kid!<br> What the hell happened here?<br> My God...<br> No. Please. Please, please.<br> No, no, no...<br> Excuse me. Sorry.<br> No, Cassie, no.<br> No.<br> No, no.<br> Please, please,<br> please, please....<br> No, Cassie...<br> What?<br> Cassie?<br> Dad?<br> You're so big!<br> Yeah, we boarded that highly<br> suspect warship Danvers pinged.<br> It was an infectious<br> garbage scowl.<br> So, thanks for the hot tip.<br> - Well, you were closer.<br> - Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.<br> You get a reading<br> on those tremors?<br> It was a mild subduction<br> under the African plate.<br> Do we have a visual? How<br> are we handling it?<br> Nat, it's an earthquake<br> under the ocean.<br> We handle it by not handling it.<br> Carol, are we seeing<br> you here next month?<br> - Not likely.<br> - What, you gonna get another haircut?<br> Listen, fur-face. I'm<br> covering a lot of territory.<br> The things that are<br> happening on Earth are<br> happening everywhere, on<br> thousands of planets.<br> That's a good point.<br> That's a good point.<br> So you might not see<br> me for a long time.<br> All right. Uh, well...<br> This channel is always active.<br> So, anything goes sideways...<br> Anyone's making trouble<br> where they shouldn't...<br> - Comes through me.<br> - Okay.<br> All right.<br> Good luck.<br> - Where are you?<br> - Mexico.<br> The federales found a<br> room full of bodies.<br> Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never<br> even had the chance to get their guns off.<br> - It's probably a rival gang...<br> - Except it isn't.<br> It's definitely Barton.<br> What he's done here, what he's<br> been doing for the last few years,<br> I mean, the scene<br> that he left...<br> I gotta tell you, there's a part of<br> me that doesn't even wanna find him.<br> Will you find out where<br> he's going next?<br> Nat...<br> Please.<br> Okay.<br> You know I'd offer to clip your dinner<br> but you seem pretty miserable already.<br> You here to do your laundry?<br> And to see a friend.<br> Clearly, your friend is fine.<br> You know I saw a pod of whales<br> when I was coming up the bridge.<br> - In the Hudson?<br> - There's fewer ships, cleaner water.<br> You know, if you're about to tell<br> me to look on the bright side...<br> Um...<br> I'm about to hit you in the head<br> with a peanut butter sandwich.<br> Sorry. Force of habit.<br> You know I keep telling everybody<br> they should move on and... grow.<br> Some do.<br> But not us.<br> - If I move on, who does this?<br> - Maybe it doesn't need to be done.<br> I used to have nothing.<br> And then I got this.<br> This job.<br> This family.<br> And I was... I was<br> better because of it.<br> And even though...<br> they're gone...<br> Now, I'm still<br> trying to be better.<br> I think we both<br> need to get a life.<br> You first.<br> Oh... Hi. Hi!<br> Is anyone home?<br> This is Scott Lang.<br> We met a few years ago, at the airport?<br> In Germany?<br> I got really big and<br> I had my mask on.<br> - You wouldn't recognize me.<br> - Is this an old message?<br> Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I<br> know you know that.<br> It's the front gate.<br> I need to talk to you guys.<br> Scott.<br> - Are you okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Have either of you guys ever<br> studied quantum physics?<br> Only in mid-conversation.<br> Alright. So...<br> Five years ago, right before...<br> Thanos,<br> I was in a place called<br> the quantum realm.<br> The quantum realm is like its<br> own microscopic universe.<br> To get in there, you have to be<br> incredibly small. Hope, she's my...<br> She... she was my...<br> She was supposed to pull me out.<br> And then Thanos happened, and<br> - I got stuck in there.<br> - Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.<br> Yeah, but that's just it.<br> It wasn't.<br> For me it was five hours.<br> See, the rules of the quantum realm<br> aren't like they are up here.<br> Everything is unpredictable. Is that<br> anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.<br> Scott.<br> What are you talking about?<br> So...<br> What I'm saying is...<br> Time works differently<br> in the quantum realm.<br> The only problem is right now, we<br> don't have a way to navigate it.<br> But what if we did?<br> I can't stop thinking about it. What<br> if we could somehow control the chaos,<br> and we could navigate it? What if<br> there was a way that we can enter<br> the quantum realm at a certain<br> point in time but then<br> exit the quantum realm at<br> another point in time? Like...<br> Like before Thanos.<br> Wait, are you talking<br> about a time machine?<br> No. No, of course not.<br> No, not a time machine.<br> It's more like a...<br> Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.<br> It's crazy.<br> But I can't stop thinking about it.<br> There's gotta be...<br> Some wa... It's crazy.<br> I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,<br> nothing sounds crazy anymore.<br> So who do we talk to about this?<br> Chow-time!<br> Morgoona.<br> Morgan H. Stark.<br> Want some lunch?<br> - Define lunch or be disintegrated.<br> - Okay.<br> You should not be<br> wearing that, okay?<br> That is part of a special anniversary<br> gift I'm making for Mom.<br> There you go. Are you<br> thinking about lunch?<br> Want a handful of crickets?<br> - No.<br> - That's what you want.<br> - How did you find this?<br> - Garage.<br> Really?<br> - Were you looking for it?<br> - No.<br> I found it, though.<br> You like going to the garage, huh?<br> So does Daddy.<br> It's fine actually. Mom never<br> wears anything I wear.<br> Now, we know what<br> it sounds like...<br> Tony after everything you've seen,<br> is anything really impossible...<br> Quantum fluctuation messes<br> with the Planck scale,<br> which then triggers the Deutsch<br> proposition. Can we agree on that?<br> Thank you.<br> In Layman's terms, it means<br> you're not coming home.<br> - I did.<br> - No.<br> You accidentally survived. It's a---<br> It's a billion-to-one<br> cosmic fluke.<br> And now you wanna pull a...<br> What do you call it?<br> - A time heist?<br> - Yeah. Time heist.<br> Of course. Why didn't we<br> think of this before?<br> Oh! Because it's laughable?<br> Because it's a pipedream?<br> The stones are in the past. We<br> can go back and we can get them.<br> We can snap our own fingers.<br> We can bring everybody back.<br> Or screw it up worse than<br> he already has, right?<br> I don't believe we would.<br> Gotta say this. Sometimes, I<br> miss that giddy optimism.<br> However, high hopes won't<br> help if there's no logical,<br> tangible, way for me to safely<br> execute said time heist.<br> I believe the most likely outcome<br> will be our collective demise.<br> Not if we strictly follow<br> the rules of time travel.<br> That means no talking to our past selves,<br> no betting on sporting events...<br> I'm gonna stop you<br> right there, Scott.<br> Are you seriously telling<br> me that your plan to<br> save the universe is based<br> on Back to the Future?<br> - No.<br> - Good. You had me worried there.<br> 'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's<br> not how quantum physics works.<br> Tony...<br> We have to take a stand.<br> We did stand. And<br> yet, here we are.<br> I know you got a lot on the line.<br> You got a wife, a daughter.<br> But I lost someone very important to me.<br> A lot of people did.<br> And now, now, we have a chance to bring<br> her back. To bring everyone back.<br> And you're telling me<br> that you won't even...<br> That's right, Scott.<br> I won't. Leave it.<br> Got a kid.<br> Mommy told me to<br> come and save you.<br> Good job. I'm saved.<br> I wish you'd come here to<br> ask me something else.<br> Anything else. Honestly, I<br> missed you guys, it was...<br> - Oh, and table's set for six.<br> - Tony, I get it.<br> And I'm happy for you.<br> I really am.<br> But this is a second chance.<br> I got my second chance<br> right here, Cap.<br> I can't roll the dice again.<br> If you don't talk shop,<br> you can stay for lunch.<br> - He's scared.<br> - He's not wrong.<br> Yeah, but I mean,<br> what are we gonna do?<br> We need him. What,<br> are we gonna stop?<br> No. I wanna do it right.<br> We're gonna need a<br> really big brain.<br> Bigger than his?<br> Come on. I feel like I'm the only<br> one eating. Try some of that.<br> Have some eggs.<br> I'm so confused.<br> - These are confusing times.<br> - Right. No, no...<br> - That's not what I meant. I...<br> - No, I get it.<br> I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.<br> - I'm wearing shirts now.<br> - Yeah! How? Why?<br> Five years ago we<br> got our asses beat.<br> Except it was worse for me.<br> Because I lost twice.<br> First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.<br> Then, we all lost.<br> - No one blamed you, Bruce.<br> - I did.<br> For years I've been<br> treating the Hulk like he's<br> some kind of disease,<br> something to get rid of.<br> But then I started looking<br> at him as the cure.<br> Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put<br> the brains and the brawn together.<br> And now look at me.<br> Best of both worlds.<br> - Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?<br> - Yes?<br> - Can we get a photo?<br> - 100%, little person.<br> Come on, step on up. You mind?<br> Oh.<br> - Say "green."<br> - Green.<br> Greeeen.<br> - Did you get that?<br> - That's good.<br> Don't you wanna grab one with me?<br> I'm Ant-Man.<br> They're Hulk fans.<br> They don't know Ant-Man.<br> - Nobody does.<br> - Wait, no, no, he wants to...<br> You want to take a<br> picture with him, right?<br> He's even saying no he doesn't.<br> I get it.<br> I don't want it either. I don't<br> want a picture with them.<br> - He's gonna feel bad.<br> - Sorry.<br> - They said they'd do it.<br> - I don't want it anymore.<br> - You'd feel bad...<br> - Take the goddamn phone.<br> Thank you, Mr. Hulk.<br> No, it's great, kids.<br> Thank you very much.<br> - Hulk out!<br> - Bruce.<br> - Dab.<br> - Bruce.<br> Listen to your Mom.<br> She knows better.<br> - About we were saying...<br> - Right.<br> The whole time travel do-over?<br> Guys, it's outside of<br> my area of expertise.<br> Well, you pulled this off.<br> I remember a time when that<br> seemed pretty impossible, too.<br> Look at a mod inspiration,<br> let me see what checks out.<br> So, recommend one last sim before<br> we pack it in for the night.<br> This time, in the shape of a<br> mobius strip, inverted. Please?<br> Processing...<br> Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle<br> factoring, and spectral decomp.<br> - Gotta take a second.<br> - Just a moment.<br> And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.<br> I'm just kinda...<br> Model rendered.<br> Shit!<br> Shit!<br> What are you doing<br> up, Little Miss?<br> - Shit.<br> - No. We don't say that.<br> Only Mommy says that word. She<br> coined it, it belongs to her.<br> Why you up?<br> 'Cause I got some important shit<br> going on here. What do you think?<br> No, I got something on my mind.<br> I got something on my mind.<br> - Was it Juice Pops?<br> - Sure was.<br> That's extortion.<br> Great minds think alike. Juice<br> Pops, exactly was on...<br> my mind.<br> You done? Yeah? Now you are.<br> - That face, goes there.<br> - Tell me a story.<br> A story.<br> Once upon a time, a little<br> girl went to bed. The end.<br> That ain't the whole story.<br> Come on, that's your<br> favorite story.<br> I love you tons.<br> I love you 3,000.<br> Wow.<br> 3,000. That's crazy.<br> Go to bed. Or I'll<br> sell all your toys.<br> Night-night.<br> Not that it's a competition,<br> but she loves me 3,000.<br> You were somewhere in<br> the low 6 to 900 range.<br> - What you reading?<br> - Just a book on composting.<br> What's new with composting?<br> - Just ....<br> - I figured it out...<br> by the way.<br> You know, just so we're talking<br> about the same thing...<br> Time travel.<br> What?<br> Wow.<br> That's...<br> Amazing, and.... terrifying.<br> That's right.<br> - I got really lucky.<br> - Yeah. I know.<br> - A lot of people didn't.<br> - No, I can't help everybody.<br> - It sorta seems like you can.<br> - Not if I stop.<br> I can put a pin in it<br> right now, and stop.<br> Tony...<br> trying to get you to stop has been one<br> of the few failures of my entire life.<br> I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked<br> box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...<br> ...go to bed.<br> But would you be able to rest?<br> Okay, here we go. Time<br> travel test number one.<br> Scott, fire up the, uhh...<br> The van thing.<br> Breakers are set. Emergency<br> generators are on standby.<br> Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't<br> wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.<br> - Excuse me?<br> - He's kidding.<br> You can't say things like that.<br> Just... it was, just a bad joke.<br> - You were kidding, right?<br> - I have no idea.<br> We're talking about time travel here.<br> Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.<br> We're good! Get your helmet on.<br> Scott, I'm gonna send you<br> back a week, but you'll walk<br> around for an hour, then bring<br> you back in 10 seconds.<br> - Makes sense?<br> - Perfectly not confusing.<br> Good luck, Scott. You got this.<br> You're right. I do,<br> Captain America.<br> On the count of three.<br> 3.. 2.. 1..<br> Guys? This doesn't feel right.<br> - What's going on? Hold on.<br> - Who is that?<br> - Is that Scott?<br> - Yes, it's Scott!<br> Ooh! My back!<br> - Can you bring him back?<br> - I'm working on it!<br> A baby.<br> - It's Scott.<br> - As a baby!<br> Bring Scott back.<br> When I say kill the<br> power, kill the power.<br> And... kill it!<br> Somebody peed my pants.<br> I don't know if it was<br> "baby" me or "old" me.<br> Or, just "me" me.<br> Time travel!<br> What?<br> I see this as an absolute win.<br> Why the long face?<br> Let me guess. He<br> turned into a baby.<br> Among other things, yeah.<br> What are you doing here?<br> That's the EPR paradox.<br> Instead of pushing Lang through time, you<br> might've wound up pushing time through Lang.<br> It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody<br> coulda cautioned you against it.<br> - You did.<br> - Oh, did I?<br> Thank God, I'm here.<br> Regardless, I fixed it.<br> A fully functioning<br> time-space GPS.<br> I just want peace.<br> Turns out, resentment is<br> corrosive, and I hate it.<br> Me, too.<br> We got a shot at getting<br> these stones, but I<br> gotta tell you my<br> priority is to bring back<br> what we lost? I hope, yes.<br> Keep what I found? I<br> have to, at all costs.<br> And, maybe not die<br> trying will be nice.<br> Sounds like a deal.<br> - Tony, I don't know...<br> - Why? He made it for you.<br> Plus, honestly I have to get it out the<br> garage before Morgan takes it sledding.<br> Thank you, Tony.<br> Will you keep that a little quietly?<br> Didn't bring one for the whole team.<br> - We are getting, the whole team, yeah?<br> - We're working on that right now.<br> - Hey, humie! Where's big green?<br> - Kitchen. I think.<br> - That's awesome.<br> - Rodent, careful on re-entry.<br> There's an idiot on<br> the landing zone.<br> Oh, God!<br> What's up, regular-sized man?<br> Kind of a step down from a golden palace<br> for an Avenger highness or whatnot.<br> Hey, have a little compassion, pal.<br> First, they've lost Asgard,<br> then half the people. They're probably<br> just happy they have a home.<br> You shouldn't have come!<br> Valkyrie!<br> Great to see you, Angry Girl.<br> I think I liked you better<br> either of the other ways.<br> - This is Rocket.<br> - How you doin'?<br> - He won't see you.<br> - That bad, huh?<br> We only see him once a month,<br> when he comes in for...<br> ...supplies.<br> - It's that bad.<br> - Yeah.<br> What the...<br> Woo! Something died in here.<br> Hello? Thor?<br> Are you here about the cable?<br> The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,<br> and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...<br> Boys! Oh, my God!<br> My God! How have you been?<br> Come here, you little rascal!<br> No, I'm good! I'm good.<br> That's not necessary!<br> Hulk, you know my friends,<br> Miek, Korg, right?<br> - Hey, boys!<br> - Hey, guys. Long time no see.<br> Beer's on the bucket. Feel<br> free to log on to the wi-fi.<br> No password, obviously.<br> Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV<br> who's called me a dickhead again.<br> - Noobmaster.<br> - Yeah, Noobmaster69.<br> Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.<br> You know, the God of Thunder?<br> Listen, buddy. If you don't log off<br> this game immediately I'm gonna fly<br> home to your house, come down to<br> that basement you're hiding in,<br> rip off your arms then<br> shove them up your butt!<br> Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to<br> your father, you little weasel!<br> Thank you, Thor.<br> Let me know if he<br> bothers you again, okay?<br> Thank you very much. I will.<br> So you guys want a drink?<br> What are you drinking?<br> We have beer, tequila,<br> all sorts of things.<br> Buddy, you all right?<br> Yes, I'm fine! Why,<br> don't I look all right?<br> You look like melted ice cream.<br> So, what's up?<br> We need your help. There might be<br> a chance we could fix everything.<br> What, like the cable? 'Cause that's<br> been driving me bananas for weeks.<br> Like Thanos.<br> Don't say that name.<br> Um, yeah. We don't actually<br> say that name in here.<br> Please take your hand off me.<br> Now, I know that...<br> guy might scare you.<br> Why would I be? Why would, why<br> would I be scared of that guy?<br> I'm the one who killed<br> that guy, remember?<br> Anyone else here<br> killed that guy?<br> Nope. Didn't think so.<br> Korg, why don't you, tell everybody<br> who chopped Thanos' big head off.<br> Umm... Stormbreaker?<br> Now, who's swinging<br> Stormbreaker?<br> I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?<br> I've been there myself.<br> You wanna know who<br> helped me out of it?<br> I don't know. Is it... Natasha?<br> It was you.<br> You helped me.<br> Why don't you ask the,<br> Asgardians down there,<br> how much my help was worth.<br> The ones that are left, anyway.<br> I think we can bring them back.<br> Stop. Just, stop...<br> I know you think I'm down here wallowing in<br> my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and<br> and saved. But I'm fine, okay?<br> We're fine, aren't we?<br> Nah, all good here, mate!<br> So, whatever it is that<br> you're offering, we're<br> not into it, don't care,<br> couldn't care less.<br> Goodbye.<br> We need you, pal.<br> There's beer on the ship.<br> What kind?<br> It's him! He's after Akihiko!<br> We never did anything to you!<br> You're done hurting people.<br> You're crazy!<br> Wait! Help me!<br> What I want...<br> You can't give me.<br> You shouldn't be here.<br> Neither should you.<br> I've got a job to do.<br> Is that what you're<br> calling this?<br> Killing all these people isn't<br> gonna bring your family back.<br> We found something.<br> A chance, maybe...<br> Don't.<br> Don't what?<br> Don't give me hope.<br> I'm sorry I couldn't<br> give it to you sooner.<br> Drifting left. On the<br> side there, Lebowski.<br> - Ratchet, how's it going?<br> - It's Rocket.<br> Take it easy. You're only<br> a genius on Earth, pal.<br> Yup.<br> Time travel suit? Not bad.<br> Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!<br> - I'm being very careful.<br> - No, you're being very Hulky.<br> - I'm being careful.<br> - These are Pym particles, all right?<br> And ever since Hank Pym got snapped<br> out of existence, this is it.<br> This is what we have. We're<br> not making any more.<br> - Scott, calm down.<br> - Sorry.<br> We've got enough for<br> one round trip, each.<br> That's it. No do-overs.<br> Plus, two test runs.<br> One test run.<br> All right. I'm not<br> ready for this.<br> I'm game.<br> I'll do it.<br> Clint, now you're gonna feel<br> a little discombobulated<br> from the chronoshift.<br> Don't worry about it.<br> Wait a second, let me<br> ask you something.<br> If we can do this, you know, go<br> back in time, why don't we just<br> find baby Thanos, you know?<br> And...<br> - First of all, that's horrible.<br> - It's Thanos.<br> And secondly, time doesn't work that way.<br> Changing the past doesn't change the future.<br> Look, we go back, we get the<br> stones before Thanos gets them...<br> Thanos doesn't have the stones.<br> Problem solved.<br> - Bingo.<br> - That's not how it works.<br> - Well, that's what I heard.<br> - What? By who? Who told you that?<br> Star Trek, Terminator,<br> TimeCop, Time After Time,<br> - Quantum Leap.<br> - A Wrinkle in Time,<br> - Somewhere in Time,<br> - Hot Tub Time Machine.<br> Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,<br> any movie that deals with time travel.<br> Die Hard? No, it's not...<br> This is known.<br> I don't know why everyone believes<br> that, but that isn't true.<br> Think about it: If you travel to the<br> past, that past becomes your future.<br> And your former present<br> becomes the past.<br> Which can't now be changed<br> by your new future...<br> Exactly.<br> So Back to the Future's<br> a bunch of bullshit?<br> All right, Clint. We're going in 3..<br> 2.. 1...<br> Cooper?<br> - Where are my headphones?<br> - Lila?<br> Lila! No!<br> Dad?<br> Dad?<br> Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?<br> Yeah.<br> It worked.<br> It worked.<br> Okay, so the "how" works.<br> Now we gotta figure out the<br> "when," and the "where."<br> Almost everyone in this<br> room has had an encounter<br> with at least one of the<br> six Infinity Stones.<br> Well, I'd subtitute the<br> word 'encounter' for 'damn<br> near been killed by one of<br> the six Infinity Stones.'<br> I haven't. I don't even know what<br> the hell you're all talking about.<br> Regardless, we only have enough Pym<br> Particles for one round trip each,<br> and these stones have been in a lot of<br> different places throughout history.<br> Our history. So, not a lot of<br> convenient spots to just drop in.<br> - Which means we have to pick our targets.<br> - Correct.<br> So. Let's start<br> with the Aether.<br> Thor, what do you know?<br> Is he asleep?<br> Where to start? Umm...<br> The Aether, first,<br> is not a stone.<br> Someone's called it a stone before.<br> Ahem...<br> It's more of a... an angry<br> sludge, sort of thing. So...<br> Someone's gonna need to amend<br> that, and stop saying that.<br> Here's an interesting<br> story, though.<br> About the Aether. My<br> grandafther, many years<br> ago, had to hide the stone<br> from the Dark Elves.<br> Scary beings. So Jane...<br> Oh, there she is. That's Jane...<br> She's... an old flame of mine.<br> She... she stuck her hand<br> inside a rock this one time...<br> and then the Aether stuck<br> itself inside her.<br> And, she became very, very sick.<br> So I had to take her to<br> Asgard, which is where I'm from.<br> And we had to try and fix her.<br> We were dating at the time, you see. I<br> got to introduce her to my Mother...<br> who's dead, and umm....<br> Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't<br> even dating anymore, so...<br> These things happen though, you know.<br> Nothing lasts forever.<br> - The only thing that...<br> - Why don't you come sit down.<br> I'm not done yet. The only thing that<br> is permanent in life, is impermanence.<br> Awesome.<br> Eggs? Breakfast?<br> No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.<br> Quill said he stole the<br> Power Stone from Morag.<br> - Is that a person?<br> - Morag's a planet.<br> Quill was a person.<br> Like a planet? Like<br> in outer space?<br> Oh, look. It's like a little<br> puppy, all happy and everything.<br> Do you wanna go to space? You<br> wanna go to space, puppy?<br> I'll take you to space.<br> - Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.<br> - What is Vormir?<br> A dominion of death, at the very<br> center of Celestial existence.<br> It's where... Thanos<br> murdered my sister.<br> Noted.<br> - That Time Stone guy...<br> - Doctor Strange.<br> Yeah, what kind<br> of doctor was he?<br> - Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.<br> - Nice place in the village, though.<br> - Yeah. Sullivan Street.<br> - Hmm... Bleecker.<br> Wait, he lived in New York?<br> - No. He lived in Toronto.<br> - Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.<br> Guys, if you pick the right year,<br> there are three stones in New York.<br> Shut the front door!<br> All right. We have a plan.<br> Six stones, three<br> teams, one shot.<br> Five years ago, we lost.<br> All of us.<br> We lost friends...<br> We lost family...<br> We lost a part of ourselves.<br> Today, we have a chance<br> to take it all back.<br> You know your teams, you<br> know your missions.<br> Get the stones, get them back.<br> One round trip each. No mistakes.<br> No do-overs.<br> Most of us are going<br> somewhere we know.<br> But it doesn't mean we<br> should know what to expect.<br> Be careful. Look out<br> for each other.<br> This is the fight of our lives.<br> And we're gonna win.<br> Whatever it takes.<br> Good luck.<br> - He's pretty good at that.<br> - Right?<br> All right. You heard the man.<br> Stroke those keys, jelly green.<br> Tractors engaged.<br> You promise to bring that<br> back in one piece, right?<br> Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br> yeah. Okay.<br> - I'll do my best.<br> - As promises go, that was pretty lame.<br> See you in a minute.<br> All right, we all have our assignments.<br> Two stones uptown, one stone, down.<br> Stay low. Keep an<br> eye on the clock.<br> Feel free to smash if<br> things don't go your way.<br> I think it's gratuitous,<br> but whatever.<br> I'd be careful going that way.<br> We just had the floors waxed.<br> Ma'am, I'm looking<br> for Doctor Strange.<br> You're about... five<br> years too early.<br> Stephen Strange is currently performing<br> surgery about twenty blocks that way.<br> What do you want from him?<br> That, actually.<br> Ah.<br> - I'm afraid not.<br> - Sorry, but I wasn't asking.<br> - You don't wanna do this.<br> - You're right. I don't.<br> But I need that stone, and<br> I don't have time to...<br> Let's start over, shall we?<br> That's Jane.<br> All right.<br> Here's the deal, Tubby:<br> You're gonna charm her and I'm<br> gonna poke her with this thing<br> and extract the Reality Stone<br> and get gone, lickety-split.<br> I'll be right back, okay? There's a<br> wine cellar, that's just down there.<br> My father used to fish<br> with a barrel of ale.<br> - I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...<br> - Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?<br> Who's the fancy broad?<br> It's my Mother.<br> She dies today.<br> Oh. That's today?<br> I can't do this.<br> I can't do this.<br> I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.<br> This was a bad idea.<br> - Come here.<br> - No, no, no. I think I'm having...<br> - I'm having a panic attack.<br> - Come here. Right here.<br> You think you're the only one who lost<br> people? What do you think we're doing here?<br> I lost the only<br> family I ever had.<br> Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick<br> with the antenna, all gone.<br> Now, I get you miss your Mom.<br> But she's gone. Really gone.<br> And there are plenty of people<br> who are only kinda gone.<br> But you can help them.<br> So is it too much to ask that you<br> brush the crumbs outta your beard,<br> make schmoopy talk to Pretty<br> Pants, and when she's not looking,<br> suck out the Infinity Stone and<br> help me get my family back?<br> Okay.<br> - Are you crying?<br> - No...<br> Yes!<br> Get it together!<br> You can do this.<br> You can do this.<br> All right?<br> - Yes, I can.<br> - Good.<br> I can do this.<br> I can't do this.<br> Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.<br> This is our shot.<br> Thor?<br> Thor!<br> Alright. Bring it down low.<br> Right on that line. That's it.<br> Down, down.<br> Hey, can we hurry it up?<br> Guys, chop-chop. Come on.<br> We're on the clock.<br> All that, is really helpful.<br> - Take care, okay?<br> - Yeah.<br> Take that stone and come back.<br> No messing around.<br> - Hey.<br> - You got this.<br> - Let's get it done.<br> - Yes, sir.<br> See you back.<br> You guys watch each other's six.<br> Yeah.<br> The coordinates for<br> Vormir are laid in.<br> All they have to do<br> is not fall out.<br> We're a long way from Budapest.<br> Okay, so, uhh...<br> We just wait around for this<br> Quill guy to show up and<br> then he leads us to the<br> Power Stone, is that it?<br> Let's take cover.<br> We're not the only ones in<br> 2014 looking for the stones.<br> Wait a minute, what are<br> you talking about right<br> now? Who else is looking<br> for these stones?<br> My father, my sister...<br> - and me.<br> - And you?<br> Where are you right now?<br> - You're welcome.<br> - I didn't ask for your help.<br> And yet, you always need it.<br> Get up.<br> - Father wants us back on the ship.<br> - Why?<br> He's found an Infinity Stone.<br> - Where?<br> - On a planet called Morag.<br> Father's plan is<br> finally in motion.<br> - One stone isn't six, Nebula.<br> - It's a start.<br> If he gets all of them...<br> Ronan's located the Power Stone.<br> I'm dispatching you to his ship.<br> - He won't like that.<br> - His alternative is death, then.<br> Ronan's obsession<br> clouds his judgement.<br> We will not fail you, Father.<br> No, you won't.<br> I swear...<br> I will make you proud.<br> We just, wait around for<br> this Quill guy to show up,<br> and then he leads us to the<br> Power Stone, is that it?<br> Let's take cover.<br> We're not the only ones in<br> 2014 looking for the stones.<br> - Who was that?<br> - I don't know...<br> My head is splitting...<br> I don't know...<br> Her synaptic drive was<br> probably damaged in battle.<br> Bring her to my ship.<br> Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like<br> they're just about wrapped up here.<br> Got it. I'm approaching<br> the elevator now.<br> If it's all the same to you...<br> I'll have that drink now.<br> All right. Good one. No standing around,<br> I'm closing up this door for later.<br> By the way, feel<br> free to clean up.<br> Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost<br> forgot that that suit<br> - did nothing for your ass.<br> - No one asked you to look.<br> I think you look great, Cap.<br> As far as I'm concerned,<br> that's America's ass.<br> - Uhh, magic wand?<br> - STRIKE team's coming to secure it.<br> We can take that<br> off your hands.<br> By all means.<br> - Careful with that thing!<br> - Unless you want your mind erased.<br> - Not in a fun way.<br> - We promise to be careful.<br> - Who are these guys?<br> - They are SHIELD...<br> Well, actually Hydra. But,<br> we didn't know that yet.<br> Seriously, you didn't? I mean...<br> they look like bad guys.<br> You're small, but<br> you're talking loud.<br> On my way down to<br> coordinate search and rescue.<br> On my way down to<br> coordinate search and rescue!<br> I mean, honestly! How do<br> you think you'll be...<br> Shut up.<br> All right, you're up, little buddy.<br> There's our stone.<br> Alright. Flick me.<br> - Whoa! Whoa, whoa.<br> - Hey! Buddy.<br> What do you think? Maximum<br> occupancy has been reached.<br> - Take the stairs!<br> - Yeah. Stop. Stop!<br> Take the stairs.<br> Take the stairs!<br> All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the<br> elevator just passing the 80th floor.<br> On it.<br> - Head to the lobby.<br> - Alright. I'll see you there.<br> Evidence secure. We're<br> en route to Dr. List.<br> No. No hitches at all, Mr.<br> Secretary.<br> Captain. I thought you were<br> coordinating search and rescue?<br> Change of plans.<br> Hey, Cap.<br> Rumlow.<br> I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm<br> gonna be running point on the scepter.<br> Sir? I don't understand.<br> We got word there may be<br> an attempt to steal it.<br> Sorry, Cap.<br> I can't give you the scepter.<br> - I'm gonna have to call the Director.<br> - That's okay. Trust me.<br> Hail Hydra.<br> So many stairs!<br> Thumbelina, do you copy?<br> I've got eyes on the prize.<br> - It is go-time.<br> - Bombs away.<br> Is, is that Axe body spray?<br> Yeah, I had a can just<br> for emergencies. Relax.<br> - Can we focus, please?<br> - I'm going inside you. Now.<br> May I ask you<br> where you're going?<br> To lunch and then Asgard.<br> I'm sorry, you are?<br> Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one<br> of the folks behind Nick Fury.<br> My friends call me Mr. Secretary.<br> I'm gonna have to ask you to<br> turn that prisoner over to me.<br> - Loki will be answering to Odin himself.<br> - Oh, he's gonna answer to us.<br> Odin can have what's left. And<br> I'm gonna need that case.<br> That's been SHIELD property<br> for over 70 years.<br> Hand over the case, Stark.<br> All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things<br> are getting dicey up here. Let's go.<br> I'm not gonna argue who's got the<br> higher authority here, all right?<br> You promise me you won't die?<br> You're only giving me a<br> mild cardiac dysrythmia.<br> That doesn't sound mild.<br> I need the case.<br> I know you got a lotta pull.<br> I'm just saying...<br> Okay. Then give me the case.<br> Do it, Lang!<br> - Get your hands off!<br> - Window's closing. Pull my pin!<br> Here goes!<br> - Stark?<br> - Stark!<br> Look, he's convulsing.<br> Give him air!<br> - Medic!<br> - Medic!<br> You got some help!<br> Stark, you--- your<br> chest machine?<br> Breathe! Breathe!<br> Good job. Meet me in the alley.<br> I'm gonna grab a quick slice.<br> No stairs!<br> You'll be fine, Stark.<br> Stay with us!<br> I'll try something, okay? I have<br> no idea if it's gonna work.<br> Yes!<br> That worked a treat.<br> That was so crazy!<br> I had no idea if<br> that was gonna work.<br> - The case...<br> - The case. It's, uhh...<br> Where's the case? Where's Loki?<br> Loki!<br> - That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?<br> - Oh, we blew it.<br> Loki!?<br> Tony, what's going on?<br> Tell me you found that cube.<br> Oh, you gotta be shitting me.<br> I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.<br> I'm not Loki.<br> And I don't wanna hurt you.<br> I can do this all day.<br> Yeah, I know. I know.<br> Where did you get this?<br> Bucky... is... alive!<br> What?<br> That is America's ass.<br> - Please, please!<br> - I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.<br> If I give up the Time Stone to help<br> your reality, I'm dooming my own.<br> With all due respect, I'm not sure<br> the science really supports that.<br> The Infinity Stones create what you<br> experience as the flow of time.<br> Remove one of the stones,<br> and that flow splits.<br> Now this may benefit your reality.<br> But my new one, not so much.<br> In this new branched reality, without our<br> chief weapon against the forces of darkness,<br> our world will be overrun.<br> Millions will suffer.<br> So, tell me, doctor, can your<br> science prevent all that?<br> No. But we can erase it.<br> Because once we're done with the stones, we<br> can return each one into its own timeline<br> at the moment it was taken.<br> So, chronologically...<br> In that reality....<br> it never left.<br> Yes, but you're leaving out<br> the most important part.<br> In order to return the<br> stones, you have to survive.<br> We will. I will. I promise.<br> I can't risk this<br> reality on a promise.<br> It's the duty, of the Sorcerer<br> Supreme to protect the Time Stone.<br> Then why the hell did<br> Strange give it away?<br> - What did you say?<br> - Strange. He gave it away.<br> He gave it to Thanos.<br> - Willingly?<br> - Yes.<br> - Why?<br> - I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.<br> Or I did.<br> Strange was meant to<br> be the best of us.<br> So he must've done<br> it for a reason.<br> I fear you might be right.<br> Thank you.<br> I'm counting on you, Bruce.<br> We all are.<br> Run diagnostics.<br> Show me her memory file.<br> Sire, the file appears entangled.<br> It was a memory, but not hers.<br> There's another consciousness<br> sharing her network.<br> Another Nebula.<br> Impossible.<br> This duplicate carries a time stamp...<br> from nine years in the future.<br> Where is this other Nebula?<br> In our solar system.<br> On Morag.<br> - Can you access her?<br> - Yes. The two are linked.<br> Search the duplicate's<br> memories, for Infinity Stones.<br> And these stones have been in a lot of<br> different places throughout history.<br> Our history. So, not a lot of<br> convenient spots to just drop in.<br> - Which means we have to pick our targets.<br> - Correct.<br> Freeze image.<br> Terrans.<br> Avengers.<br> Unruly wretches. What's<br> that reflection?<br> Amplify this, Maw.<br> I don't understand.<br> - Two Nebulas.<br> - No. The same Nebula.<br> From two different times.<br> Set course for Morag. Scan<br> the duplicate's memories.<br> I want to see everything.<br> My ladies, I'll see you after.<br> Go on.<br> - What are you doing?<br> - Ahh!<br> You're better off leaving the<br> sneaking to your brother.<br> Yeah, I was simply just<br> going for a walk, and uh...<br> What are you wearing?<br> I always wear this. This<br> is one of my favorites.<br> What's wrong with your eye?<br> Oh, my eye. That's... you<br> remember the Battle of Haroquin?<br> When I got hit in the<br> face with a broadsword?<br> You're not the Thor I<br> know at all, are you?<br> Yes, I am.<br> The future hasn't been<br> kind to you, has it?<br> I didn't say I'm<br> from the future.<br> I was raised by witches, boy.<br> I see with more than<br> eyes, and you know that.<br> I am totally, totally<br> from the future!<br> Yes, you are.<br> - I really need to talk to you.<br> - We can talk.<br> His head was over there...<br> His body over there...<br> What was the point.<br> I was too late.<br> I was just standing there.<br> - Some idiot with an ax.<br> - You're no idiot.<br> You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel<br> from the wisest person in Asgard.<br> - I guess, yeah.<br> - Idiot? No.<br> - A failure? Absolutely.<br> - That's a little bit harsh.<br> You do know what<br> that makes you?<br> Just like everyone else.<br> I'm not supposed to be<br> like everyone else, am I?<br> Everyone fails at who they<br> are supposed to be, Thor.<br> The measure of a<br> person, of a hero<br> is how well they succeed<br> at being who they are.<br> I really missed you, Mum.<br> Thor! I got it!<br> Get that rabbit!<br> - Ma, I have to tell you something.<br> - No, son. You don't.<br> You're here to repair<br> your future, not mine.<br> - But this is about your future.<br> - It's none of my business.<br> Hey.<br> You must be Mom.<br> I got the thing. Come<br> on, we got to move.<br> - I wish we had more time.<br> - This was a gift.<br> And you're going to be the<br> man you're meant to be.<br> - I love you, Mom.<br> - I love you.<br> And eat a salad.<br> - Come on. We gotta go.<br> - Goodbye.<br> - Three... two...<br> - No, wait!<br> Wh- what am I looking at?<br> Oh, sometimes it takes a second.<br> I'm still worthy.<br> Oh, boy.<br> Goodbye, Mom.<br> So he's an idiot?<br> What's that?<br> The tool of a thief.<br> Whoa, whoa,<br> whoa, whoa...<br> This is the part where spikes come out,<br> with skeletons on the end and everything...<br> What are you talking about?<br> When you break into a place called<br> the temple of the Power Stone,<br> There's gonna be a bunch of booby<br> traps--- Okay. All right. Go ahead.<br> I wasn't always like this.<br> Me either.<br> But we work with<br> what we got, right?<br> Sync up.<br> Three.. two.. one...<br> You murdered trillions!<br> You should be grateful.<br> - Where are the stones?<br> - Gone.<br> - Reduced to atoms.<br> - You used them two days ago.<br> I used the stones to destroy the stones.<br> It nearly killed me.<br> But the work is done.<br> It always will be.<br> I am inevitable.<br> - What did you do to them?<br> - Nothing. Yet.<br> They're not trying to stop something<br> I'm going to do in our time.<br> They're trying to undo something<br> I've already done in theirs.<br> The stones...<br> I found them all.<br> I won.<br> Tipped the cosmic<br> scales to balance.<br> This is your future.<br> It's my destiny.<br> My father is many things. A<br> liar is not one of them.<br> Thank you, Daughter.<br> Perhaps I treated<br> you too harshly...<br> And that, is destiny fulfilled.<br> Sire, your Daughter...<br> No...<br> ...is a traitor.<br> That's not me. It's not. I could never...<br> I would never betray you. Never.<br> I know.<br> And you'll have the<br> chance to prove it.<br> No...<br> He knows!<br> Barton? Barton, come in.<br> Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem.<br> Come on!<br> Come in, we have a prob....<br> Thanos knows.<br> Thanos...<br> Cap...<br> Sorry, buddy.<br> We got a problem.<br> Huh. Yeah, we do.<br> - Well, what are we gonna do now?<br> - You know what, give me a break, Steve.<br> I just got hit in the<br> head with a Hulk.<br> You said that we had one shot.<br> This, this was our shot.<br> We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.<br> Six stones or nothing.<br> You're repeating yourself, you know that?<br> You're repeating yourself.<br> You're repeating yourself.<br> You're repeating yourself.<br> - No!<br> - Come on.<br> You never wanted a time heist, you<br> went on board with the time heist...<br> - I dropped the ball.<br> - You ruined the time heist.<br> - Is that what I did?<br> - Yeah!<br> Are there any other options<br> with the Tesseract?<br> No, no, no. There's<br> no other options.<br> There's no do-overs. We're<br> not going anywhere else.<br> We have one particle left. Each.<br> That's it, alright? We use that...<br> Bye, bye. You're not going home.<br> Yeah, well if we don't try...<br> then no one else is<br> going home, either.<br> I got it.<br> There's another way. To retake the<br> Tesseract and acquire new particles.<br> We'll stroll down memory lane.<br> Military installation, Garden State.<br> Why were they both there?<br> They were there at a...I've<br> a vaguely exact idea.<br> How vague?<br> What are you talking about?<br> Where are we going?<br> - I know for a fact they were there...<br> - Who's they?<br> - What are we doing?<br> - And I know how I know.<br> Guys, what's up? What is it?<br> Well, it looks like<br> we're improvising.<br> - Right.<br> - What are we improvising?<br> Scott, get this back<br> to the compound.<br> Suit up.<br> What's in New Jersey?<br> - 0-4, 0-4...<br> - Uhh, 0-7.<br> - 0-7.<br> - Excuse me...<br> 1-9-7-0.<br> - Are you sure?<br> - Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.<br> America. Rogers. Look,<br> if you do this,<br> and this doesn't work,<br> you're not coming back.<br> Thanks for the pep<br> talk, pissant.<br> You trust me?<br> I do.<br> Your call.<br> Here we go.<br> Hey, man!<br> Make love, not war!<br> Clearly, you weren't<br> actually born here, right?<br> The idea of me was.<br> Right. Well, imagine<br> you're SHIELD, running a<br> quasi-fascistic<br> intelligence organization.<br> Where do you hide it?<br> In plain sight.<br> Good luck on your<br> mission, Captain.<br> Good luck on your<br> project, doctor.<br> You're new here?<br> Not exactly.<br> Gotcha.<br> Back in the game.<br> Arnim, you in there?<br> Arnim?<br> Hey!<br> The door's this way, pal.<br> Oh, yeah.<br> I'm looking for Dr. Zola.<br> Have you seen him?<br> Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,<br> I haven't seen a soul.<br> Pardon me.<br> Do I know you?<br> No, sir. I'm, a...<br> visitor from MIT.<br> Huh. MIT.<br> Got a name?<br> Howard.<br> Well that'll be<br> easy to remember.<br> Howard...<br> ...Potts.<br> Well, I'm Howard Stark.<br> Hi.<br> Shit. Now, don't pull it.<br> Yeah...<br> You look a little green around<br> the gills there, Potts.<br> I'm fine. Just, long hours.<br> Wanna get some air?<br> - Hello, Potts.<br> - Yeah. That would be swell.<br> - That way.<br> - Okay.<br> Need your briefcase?<br> You're not one of<br> those, are ya, Potts?<br> - Hello.<br> - Dr. Pym?<br> That would be the number<br> that you called. Yes.<br> This is Capt. Stevens<br> from shipping.<br> - We have a package for you.<br> - Bring it up.<br> Well, that's the thing, sir.<br> We can't.<br> I'm confused. I thought<br> that was your job.<br> Well, it's just... Sir,<br> the box is glowing and,<br> to be honest, some of our mail<br> guys aren't feeling that great.<br> They didn't know<br> better, did they?<br> Yeah, they did. You<br> better get down here.<br> Excuse me. Out of the way!<br> So, flowers and sauerkraut. You<br> got a big date tonight?<br> My wife's expecting.<br> And, uh... Too much<br> time in the office.<br> - Congratulations.<br> - Thanks. Hold this, will you?<br> Yeah, sure.<br> - How far along is she?<br> - I don't know... uh...<br> She's at the point where she can't<br> stand the sound of my chewing.<br> I guess I'll be eating<br> dinner in the pantry again.<br> I have a little girl.<br> A girl would be nice. Less of a chance<br> she'd turn out exactly like me.<br> What'd be so awful about that?<br> Let's just say that the greater<br> good has rarely outweighed<br> my own self-interests.<br> - And you've never seen these 2 men before?<br> - No, I've got an eye for this.<br> - The 2 of them looked fishy.<br> - Can you describe them?<br> - Well, one of them had a hippie beard.<br> - Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?<br> Definitely Mungo Jerry.<br> Yeah, this is Chesler. I<br> need every available MPs<br> on sub-level 6. We have<br> a potential breach.<br> So, where are you<br> at with names?<br> Well, if it's a boy,<br> my wife likes Almanzo.<br> Might wanna let that stew on.<br> You got time.<br> Let me ask you a question.<br> When your kid was born...<br> - were you nervous?<br> - Wildly. Yeah.<br> Did you feel qualified?<br> Like you had any idea how to<br> successfully operate that thing?<br> I literally pieced it<br> together as I went along,<br> I thought about what<br> my Dad did, and...<br> My old man, he never met a problem<br> he couldn't solve with a belt.<br> I thought my Dad<br> was tough on me.<br> And now, looking back, I just<br> remember the good stuff, you know.<br> - He did drop the odd pearl.<br> - Yeah? Like what?<br> "No amount of money ever<br> bought a second of time."<br> Smart guy.<br> He did his best.<br> Let me tell you. That<br> kid's not even here yet<br> and, there's nothing I<br> wouldn't do for him.<br> Good to meet you, Potts.<br> Yeah, Howard...<br> Everything's gonna be all right.<br> Thank you for everything...<br> ...you've done for<br> this country.<br> Jarvis.<br> Have we ever met that guy?<br> Seems very familiar.<br> Weird beard, though.<br> - You're weak.<br> - I'm you.<br> You can stop this.<br> You know you want to.<br> Did you see what<br> happens in the future?<br> Thanos finds the Soul Stone.<br> You wanna know<br> how he does that?<br> You wanna know, what<br> he does to you?<br> That's enough.<br> You disgust me.<br> But, that doesn't<br> mean you're useless.<br> How do I look?<br> Wow...<br> Under different circumstances,<br> this would be totally awesome.<br> I bet the raccoon didn't<br> have to climb a mountain.<br> Technically, he's not<br> a raccoon, you know.<br> Whatever. He eats garbage.<br> Welcome.<br> Natasha, daughter of Ivan.<br> Clint, son of Edith.<br> Who are you?<br> Consider me a guide.<br> To you, and to all who<br> seek the Soul Stone.<br> Okay. You tell us where it is.<br> Then we'll be on our way.<br> If only it were that easy.<br> What you seek lies<br> in front of you...<br> ...as does what you fear.<br> The stone is down there.<br> For one of you.<br> For the other...<br> In order to take the stone, you<br> must lose that which you love.<br> An everlasting exchange.<br> A soul, for a soul.<br> How's it going?<br> Jesus...<br> Maybe he's making this shit up.<br> No. I don't think so.<br> Why, 'cause he knows<br> your Daddy's name?<br> I didn't.<br> Thanos left here with the stone<br> without his daughter.<br> It's not a coincidence.<br> Yeah.<br> Whatever it takes.<br> Whatever it takes.<br> If we don't get that stone,<br> billions of people stay dead.<br> Then I guess we both<br> know who it's gotta be.<br> I guess we do.<br> I'm starting to think, we've been<br> different people here, Natasha.<br> For the last five years I've been trying<br> to do one thing: Get to right here.<br> That's all it's been about.<br> Bringing everybody back.<br> - Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.<br> - What, you think I wanna do it?<br> I'm trying to save<br> your life, you idiot.<br> Yeah well, I don't want<br> you to, because I...<br> Natasha, you know<br> what I've done.<br> You know what I've become.<br> I don't judge people on<br> their worst mistakes.<br> Maybe you should.<br> You didn't.<br> You're a pain in my<br> ass, you know that?<br> Okay.<br> You win.<br> Tell my family I love them.<br> You tell them yourself.<br> Damn you!<br> Let me go.<br> No.<br> Please, no.<br> It's okay.<br> Please...<br> Did we get them all?<br> You telling me this'll<br> actually work?<br> Clint, where's Nat?<br> Do we know if she had family?<br> Yeah. Us.<br> What?<br> I just asked him a question...<br> Yeah, you're acting like she's dead.<br> Why are we acting like she's dead?<br> We have the stones, right?<br> As long as we have<br> the stones, Cap, we can bring<br> her back, isn't that right?<br> So stop this shit. We're the<br> Avengers, get it together.<br> We can't get her back.<br> - Wha- what?<br> - It can't be undone. It can't.<br> I'm sorry. No offense, but you're<br> a very earthly being. Okay?<br> We're talking about space magic.<br> And "can't" seems very () don't you think?<br> Look, I know that I'm way<br> outside my paygrade here.<br> But she still isn't<br> here, is she?<br> - Now that's my point.<br> - It can't be undone.<br> Or that's at least what the,<br> great floating guy had to say.<br> Maybe you wanna go talk to him?<br> Okay?<br> Go grab your hammer, and you<br> go fly and you talk to him.<br> It was supposed to be me.<br> She sacrificed her life for that<br> goddamned stone. She bet her life on it.<br> She's not coming back.<br> We have to make it worth it.<br> We have to.<br> We will.<br> Boom!<br> All right. The glove's ready.<br> Question is, who's gonna<br> snap their freaking fingers?<br> I'll do it.<br> It's okay.<br> - No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop.<br> - Hey, hey...<br> Thor, just wait.<br> We haven't decided who's<br> gonna put that on yet.<br> I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting<br> around waiting for the right opportunity?<br> We should at least discuss it.<br> Look, us sitting here staring at that<br> thing is not gonna bring everybody back.<br> I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So<br> this responsibility falls upon me.<br> It's my duty. It's not that... It's...<br> stop it! Just let me.<br> Just let me do it. Just<br> let me do something good.<br> - Something great.<br> - Look...<br> It's not just the fact that<br> that glove is channeling<br> enough energy to light up a<br> continent, I'm telling you<br> you're in no condition.<br> What do you think is coursing<br> through my veins right now?<br> Cheez Whiz?<br> - Lightning.<br> - Yeah.<br> Lightning won't help you, pal.<br> It's gotta be me.<br> You saw what those stones did to Thanos.<br> It almost killed him.<br> None of you could survive.<br> How do we know you will?<br> I don't. But the<br> radiation's mostly gamma.<br> It's like...<br> I was meant for this.<br> Good to go, yeah?<br> Let's do it.<br> You remember everyone<br> Thanos snapped away five<br> years ago and just bringing<br> them back to now, today.<br> Don't change anything<br> from the last five years.<br> Got it.<br> Friday, do me a favor and<br> activate protocol 8.<br> Yes, boss.<br> Everybody comes home.<br> - Take it off. Take it off!<br> - No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?<br> Talk to me, Banner.<br> I'm okay. I'm okay.<br> Bruce!<br> Don't move him.<br> - Did it work?<br> - Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.<br> Honey.<br> Honey.<br> Guys...<br> I think it worked!<br> I can't breathe. I can't breathe!<br> I can't breathe.<br> Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.<br> Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!<br> Hurry up! Hurry up!<br> Come on!<br> Rhodey!<br> Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're<br> in the lower level, it's flooding!<br> - What?<br> - We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!<br> Wait! I'm here! I'm<br> here, can you hear me?<br> Cap?<br> Daughter.<br> Yes, Father.<br> So, this is the future.<br> Well done.<br> Thank you, Father. They<br> suspected nothing.<br> The arrogant never do.<br> Go.<br> Find the stones.<br> Bring them to me.<br> What will you do?<br> Wait.<br> Tell me something.<br> In the future, what<br> happens to you and me?<br> I tried to kill you.<br> Several times.<br> But eventually,<br> we become friends.<br> We become sisters.<br> Come on.<br> We can stop him.<br> Come on, buddy. Wake up.<br> That's my man.<br> You lose this again,<br> I'm keeping it.<br> What happened?<br> We messed with time.<br> It tends to mess back.<br> You'll see.<br> What's he been doing?<br> Absolutely nothing.<br> Where are the stones?<br> Lost somewhere under all this.<br> All I know is he<br> doesn't have them.<br> So we keep it that way.<br> - You know it's a trap, right?<br> - Yeah...<br> I don't much care.<br> Good.<br> Just as long as we're<br> all in agreement.<br> Let's kill him<br> properly this time.<br> You could not live<br> with your own failure.<br> Where did that bring you?<br> Back to me.<br> I thought by eliminating<br> half of life,<br> the other half would thrive.<br> But you've shown me,<br> that's impossible.<br> And as long as there are those<br> that remember what was,<br> there will always be those that<br> are unable to accept what can be.<br> They will resist.<br> Yep. We're all<br> kinds of stubborn.<br> I'm thankful.<br> Because now, I know<br> what I must do.<br> I will shred this universe<br> down to its last atom.<br> And then...<br> With the stones you've collected<br> for me, create a new one.<br> Teeming with life,<br> but knows not what it has lost<br> but only what it has been given.<br> A grateful universe.<br> Born out of blood.<br> They'll never know it.<br> Because you won't be<br> alive to tell them.<br> See you on the other side, man.<br> Hang on! I'm coming!<br> Oh, hey...<br> I know you.<br> Father. I have the stones.<br> What?!<br> Stop.<br> You're betraying us?<br> You don't have to do this.<br> I am... this.<br> No, you're not.<br> You've seen what we become.<br> Nebula, listen to her.<br> You can change.<br> He won't let me.<br> No!<br> Okay, Thor. Hit me.<br> Boss, wake up.<br> I knew it!<br> In all my years of conquest...<br> violence...<br> slaughter...<br> It was never personal.<br> But I'll tell you now...<br> what I'm about to do<br> to your stubborn,<br> annoying little planet...<br> I'm gonna enjoy it.<br> Very, very much.<br> Cap, you hear me?<br> Cap, it's Sam.<br> Can you hear me?<br> On your left.<br> Is that everyone?<br> What, you wanted more?<br> Avengers...<br> ... assemble.<br> No, no. Give me that.<br> You have the little one.<br> Hey!<br> Holy cow.<br> You will not believe what's been going on.<br> Do you remember when we were in space?<br> And I got all dusty? I must've passed<br> out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone.<br> But Doctor Strange was there, right?<br> He was like,<br> "It's been five years.<br> Come on, they need us!"<br> And then he started doing the yellow<br> sparkly thing that he does all the time...<br> What are you doing?<br> This is nice.<br> Gamora?<br> I thought I lost you.<br> Don't... touch... me!<br> You missed the first time...<br> then you got them<br> both the second time.<br> This is the one?

Thanos<br> destroyed the quantum tunnel.<br> Hold on!<br> That wasn't our<br> only time machine.<br> Anyone see an ugly<br> brown van up there?<br> Yes!<br> But you're not gonna<br> like where it's parked.<br> Scott, how long you need<br> to get that thing working?<br> Maybe ten minutes.<br> Get it started. We'll<br> get the stones to you.<br> We're on it, Cap.<br> Hey.<br> You said one out of 14<br> million, we win, yeah?<br> Tell me this is it.<br> If I tell you what<br> happens, it won't happen.<br> You better be right.<br> It's a mess back here.<br> It's... it's dead.<br> - What?<br> - It's dead.<br> I have to hotwire it.<br> Where's Nebula?<br> She's not responding.<br> Sire!<br> Clint!<br> Give it to me.<br> You took everything from me.<br> I don't even know who you are.<br> You will.<br> I got it!<br> Activate Instant Kill!<br> Rain fire!<br> But Sire, our troops!<br> Just do it!<br> Is anyone else seeing this?<br> I got this.<br> I got this!<br> Okay, I don't got this.<br> - Help! Somebody, help!<br> - Hey, Queens. Heads up.<br> Hang on. I got you, kid.<br> Hey! Nice to meet---<br> Oh! My God!<br> What the hell is this?<br> Friday, what are they firing at?<br> Something just entered<br> the upper atmosphere.<br> Oh, yeah!<br> Danvers, we need an assist here.<br> Hi. I'm Peter Parker.<br> Hey, Peter Parker. Got<br> something for me?<br> I don't know how you're<br> gonna get through all that.<br> Don't worry.<br> She's got help.<br> I am... inevitable.<br> And I...<br> am...<br> ... Iron Man.<br> Mr. Stark?<br> Hey...<br> Mr. Stark? Can you hear me?<br> It's Peter.<br> We won.<br> Mr. Stark....<br> We won, Mr. Stark.<br> We won and you did it, sir.<br> You did it.<br> I'm sorry... Tony...<br> - Hey.<br> - Hey, Pep...<br> - Friday?<br> - Life functions critical.<br> Tony.<br> Look at me.<br> We're gonna be okay.<br> You can rest now.<br> Everybody wants a<br> happy ending, right?<br> But it doesn't always<br> roll that way.<br> Maybe this time.<br> I'm hoping if you<br> play this back,<br> it's in celebration.<br> I hope families are reunited,<br> I hope we get it back,<br> and something like a<br> normal version of the<br> planet has been restored.<br> If there ever was such a thing.<br> God, what a world.<br> Universe, now.<br> If you told me ten years<br> ago that we weren't alone,<br> let alone, you know,<br> to this extent,<br> I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised.<br> But come on, you know?<br> That epic forces of darkness and<br> light that have come into play.<br> And, for better or worse,<br> that's the reality Morgan's gonna<br> have to find a way to grow up in.<br> So I found the time and I<br> recorded a little greeting...<br> In the case of an untimely death.<br> On my part.<br> Not that, death in any<br> time isn't untimely.<br> This time travel thing that we're<br> gonna try and pull off tomorrow,<br> it's, it's got me scratching<br> my head about this.<br> But then again, that's the hero gig.<br> Part of the journey is the end.<br> Everything's gonna work out<br> exactly the way it's supposed to.<br> I love you 3,000.<br> You know, I wish<br> there was a way...<br> that I could let her know.<br> That we won.<br> We did it.<br> She knows.<br> They both do.<br> How you doing, Squirt?<br> - Good.<br> - You good?<br> - Okay. You hungry?<br> - Mm-hmm.<br> - What do you want?<br> - Cheeseburgers.<br> You know your Dad<br> liked cheeseburgers?<br> I'm gonna get you all the<br> cheeseburgers you want.<br> Okay.<br> So, when can we expect you back?<br> - About that...<br> - Thor. Your people need a king.<br> No, they already have one.<br> That's funny.<br> You're being serious?<br> It's time for me to be<br> who I am rather than<br> who I'm supposed to be.<br> But you, you're a leader.<br> That's who you are.<br> You know I'd make a lot<br> of changes around here.<br> I'm counting on it.<br> Your Majesty.<br> What will you do?<br> I'm not sure.<br> For the first time in a<br> thousand years, I...<br> I have no path. I do<br> have a ride, though.<br> Move it or lose it, hairbag.<br> Well, here we are.<br> Tree! Good to see you.<br> Well...<br> The As-Guardians of the<br> Galaxy back together again.<br> Where to first?<br> Just so you know, this is my ship still.<br> I'm in charge.<br> I know. I know. Of<br> course, you are.<br> Of course.<br> See, you say of course, but<br> then you touch the map.<br> It makes you think that maybe you<br> didn't realize I was in charge.<br> Quail, that's your own<br> insecurities in there. Okay?<br> I'm merely trying to be of service.<br> An assistant.<br> - Quill.<br> - That's what I said.<br> You should fight one another<br> for the honor of leadership.<br> Sounds fair.<br> - It's not necessary.<br> - It's not.<br> Okay?<br> I got some blasters unless<br> you guys wanna use knives.<br> Oh, yes. Please, use knives.<br> I am Groot.<br> Not necessary.<br> There shall be no<br> knifing one another.<br> Everybody knows who's in charge.<br> It's me.<br> Yes, you! Of course!<br> Of course. Of course.<br> Remember...<br> You have to return the stones at<br> the exact moment you got them.<br> Or you're gonna open up a bunch<br> of nasty alternative realities.<br> Don't worry, Bruce.<br> Clip all the branches.<br> You know, I tried.<br> When I had the gauntlet, the stones,<br> I really tried to bring her back.<br> - I miss them, man.<br> - Me, too.<br> You know, if you want,<br> I can come with you.<br> You're a good man, Sam.<br> This one's on me, though.<br> Don't do anything stupid<br> 'till I get back.<br> How can I? You're taking<br> all the stupid with you.<br> Gonna miss you, Buddy.<br> It's gonna be okay, Buck.<br> How long is this gonna take?<br> For him? As long as he<br> needs, For us, five seconds.<br> Ready, Cap?<br> Alright. We'll meet<br> you back here, okay?<br> You bet.<br> Going quantum. Three..<br> two.. one...<br> And returning in, five,<br> four, three, two, one...<br> Where is he?<br> I don't know. He blew right by his<br> time stamp. He should be here.<br> - Well, get him back.<br> - I'm trying.<br> - Get him the hell back.<br> - I said, I'm trying!<br> Sam.<br> Go ahead.<br> Cap?<br> Hi, Sam.<br> So did something go wrong,<br> or did something go right?<br> Well, after I put the<br> stones back, I thought...<br> Maybe I'll try some<br> of that life Tony was...<br> telling me to get.<br> How did that work out for you?<br> It was beautiful.<br> I'm happy for you. Truly.<br> Thank you.<br> Only thing bumming me<br> out is the fact I have<br> to live in a world<br> without Captain America.<br> Oh...<br> That reminds me...<br> Try it on.<br> How's it feel?<br> Like it's someone else's.<br> It isn't.<br> Thank you.<br> I'll do my best.<br> That's why it's yours.<br> You wanna tell me about her?<br> No.<br> No, I don't think I will.<br> Subbed By: Fuj69Film(iamdepressed69)<br> Jeej FujjuF<br>
