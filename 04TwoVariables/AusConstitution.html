<p><b>An Act to constitute the Commonwealth of Australia</b></p>
<p><b>[9th July 1900]</b></p>
<p>Whereas the people of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, 
Queensland, and Tasmania, humbly relying on the blessing of Almighty 
God, have agreed to unite in one indissoluble Federal Commonwealth under
 the Crown of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and under
 the Constitution hereby established:</p>
<p>And whereas it is expedient to provide for the admission into the 
Commonwealth of other Australasian Colonies and possessions of the 
Queen:</p>
<p>Be it therefore enacted by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and
 with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and 
Commons, in this present Parliament assembled, and by the authority of 
the same, as follows:</p>
<p>1.  This Act may be cited as the <i>Commonwealth of Australia Constitution</i> Act.</p>
<p>2.  The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to
 Her Majesty’s heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United 
Kingdom.</p>
<p>3.  It shall be lawful for the Queen, with the advice of the Privy 
Council, to declare by proclamation that, on and after a day therein 
appointed, not being later that one year after the passing of this Act,

 Tasmania, and also, if Her Majesty is satisfied that the people of 
Western Australia have agreed thereto, of Western Australia, shall be 
united in a Federal Commonwealth under the name of the Commonwealth of 
Australia.  But the Queen may, at any time after the proclamation, 
appoint a Governor-General for the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>4.  The Commonwealth shall be established, and the Constitution of 
the Commonwealth shall take effect, on and after the day so appointed.  
But the Parliaments of the several colonies may at any time after the 
passing of this Act make any such laws, to come into operation on the 
day so appointed, as they might have made of the Constitution had taken 
effect at the passing of this Act.</p>
<p>5.  This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth
 under the Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, judges, and 
people of every State and of every part of the Commonwealth, 
notwithstanding anything in the laws of any State; and the laws of the 
Commonwealth shall be in force on all British ships, the Queen’s ships 
of war excepted, whose first port of clearance and whose port of 
destination are in the Commonwealth.</p>

 colonies or territories as may be admitted into or established by the 
Commonwealth as States; and each of such parts of the Commonwealth shall
 be called “a State”.</p>
<p>        “Original States” shall mean such States as are parts of the Commonwealth at its establishment.</p>
<p>7.  The <i>Federal Council of Australasia Act</i>, 1885, is hereby 
repealed, but so as not to affect any laws passed by the Federal Council
 of Australasia and in force at the establishment of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>        Any such law may be repealed as to any State by the 
Parliament of the Commonwealth, or as to any colony not being a State by
 the Parliament thereof.</p>
<p>8.  After the passing of this Act the <i>Colonial Boundaries Act</i>,
 1895, shall not apply to any colony which becomes a State of the

<p>9.  The Constitution of the Commonwealth shall be as follows:</p>

The Schedule.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><a name="ch1">Chapter I</a> – The Parliament</b></p>
<p><strong>Part I – General</strong></p>
<p>1.  The legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a 
Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a 
House of Representatives, and which is herein-after called “The 
Parliament,” or “The Parliament of the Commonwealth.”</p>
<p>2.  A Governor-General appointed by the Queen shall be Her Majesty’s 
representative in the Commonwealth, and shall have and may exercise in 
the Commonwealth during the Queen’s pleasure, but subject to this 
Constitution, such powers and functions of the Queen as Her Majesty may 
be pleased to assign to him.</p>
<p>3.  There shall be payable to the Queen out of the Consolidated 
Revenue fund of the Commonwealth, for the salary of the 
Governor-General, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise 
provides, shall be ten thousand pounds. The salary of the 
Governor-General shall not be altered during his continuance in office.</p>
<p>4.  The provisions of this Constitution relating to the 
Governor-General extend and apply to the Governor-General for the time 
being, or such person as the Queen may appoint to administer the 
Government of the Commonwealth; but no such person shall be entitled to 
receive any salary from the Commonwealth in respect of any other office 
during his administration of the Government of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>5.  The Governor-General may appoint such times for holding the 
sessions of the Parliament as he thinks fit, and may also from time to 
time, by Proclamation or otherwise, prorogue the Parliament, and may in 
like manner dissolve the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>        After any general election the Parliament shall be summoned 
to meet not later than thirty days after the day appointed for the 
return of the writs.  The Parliament shall be summoned to meet not later
 than six months after the establishment of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>6.  There shall be a session of the Parliament once at least in every
 year, so that twelve months shall not intervene between the last 
sitting of the Parliament in one session and its first sitting in the 
nest session.</p>
<p><strong>Part II – The Senate</strong></p>
<p>7.  The Senate shall be composed of senators for each State, directly
 chosen by the people of the State, voting, until the Parliament 
otherwise provides, as one electorate.</p>
<p>        But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise 
provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an
 Original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and 
determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and 
in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate.</p>
<p>        Until the Parliament otherwise provides there shall be six 
senators for each Original State.  The Parliament may make laws 
increasing or diminishing the number of senators for each State, but so 
that equal representation of the several Original States shall be 
maintained and that no Original State shall have less than six senators.
  The senators shall be chosen for a term of six years, and the names of
 the senators chosen for each State shall be certified by the Government
 to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>8.  The qualification of electors of senators shall be in each State 
that which is prescribed by this Constitution, or by the Parliament, as 
the qualification for electors of members of the House of 
Representatives; but in the choosing of senators each elector shall vote
 only once.</p>
<p>9.  The Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws prescribing the 
method of choosing senators, but so that the method shall be uniform for
 all the States.  Subject to any such law, the Parliament of each State 
may make laws prescribing the method of choosing the senators for that 
State.</p>
<p>The Parliament of a State may make laws for determining the times and places of elections of senators for the State.</p>
<p>10. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, but subject to this 
constitution, the laws in force in each State, for the time being, 
relating to elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of 
the State shall, as nearly as practicable, apply to elections of 
senators for the State.</p>
<p>11. The Senate may proceed to despatch of business, notwithstanding 
the failure of any State to provide for its representation in the 
Senate.</p>
<p>12. The Governor of any State may cause writs to be issued for 
elections of senators for the State.  In case of the dissolution of the 
Senate the writs shall be issued within ten days from the proclamation 
of such dissolution.</p>
<p>13. As soon as may be after the Senate first meets, and after each 
first meeting of the Senate following a dissolution thereof, the Senate 
shall divide the senators chosen for each State into two classes, as 
nearly equal in number as practicable; and the places of the senators of
 the first class shall become vacant at the expiration of three years, 
and the places of those of the second class at the expiration of six 
years, from the beginning of their term of service; and afterwards the 
places of senators shall be vacant at the expiration of six years from 
the beginning of their term of service.</p>
<p>The election to fill vacant places shall be made within one year before the places are to become vacant.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this section the term of service of a senator 
shall be taken to begin on the first day of July following the day of 
his election, except in the cases of the first election and of the 
election next after any dissolution of the Senate, when it shall be 
taken to begin on the first day of July preceding the day of his 
election.</p>
<p>14. Whenever the number of senators for a State is increased or 
diminished, the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make such provision 
for the vacating of the places of senators for the State as it deems 
necessary to maintain regularity in the rotation.</p>
<p>15. If the place of a senator becomes vacant before the expiration of
 his term of service, the Houses of Parliament of the State for which he
 was chosen, sitting and voting together, or, if there is only one House
 of that Parliament, that House, shall choose a person to hold the place
 until the expiration of the term.  But if the Parliament of the State 
is not in session when the vacancy is notified, the Governor of the 
State, with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, may appoint a 
person to hold the place until the expiration of fourteen days from the 
beginning of the next session of the Parliament of the State or the 
expiration of the term, whichever first happens.</p>
<p>Where a vacancy has at any time occurred in the place of a senator 
chosen by the people of a State and, at the time when he was so chosen, 
he was publicly recognised by a particular political party as being an 
endorsed candidate, a person chosen or appointed under this section in 
consequence of that vacancy, or in consequence of that vacancy and a 
subsequent vacancy or vacancies, shall, unless there is no member of 
that party available to be chosen or appointed, be a member of that 
party.</p>
<p>        Where</p>
<p>(a)     in accordance with the last preceding paragraph, a member of a
 particular political party is chosen or appointed to hold the place of a
 senator whose place had become vacant; and</p>
<p>(b)     before taking his seat he cease to be a member of that party 
(otherwise than by reason of the party having ceased to exist),</p>
<p>        he shall be deemed not to have been so chosen or appointed 
and the vacancy shall be again notified in accordance with section 
twenty-one of this Constitution.</p>
<p>        The name of a senator chosen or appointed under this section 
shall be certified by the Governor of the State to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>        If the place of a senator chosen by the people of a State at 
the election of senators last held before the commencement of the <i>Constitution Alteration</i>
 (Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977 became vacant before that commencement 
and, at that commencement, no person chosen by the House or Houses of 
Parliament of the State, or appointed by the Governor of the State, in 
consequence of that vacancy, or in consequence of that vacancy and a 
subsequent vacancy or vacancies, held office, this section applies as if
 the place of the senator chosen by the people of the State had become 
vacant after that commencement.</p>
<p>        A senator holding office at the commencement of the <i>Constitution Alteration</i>
 (Senate Casual Vacancies) 1977, being a senator appointed by the 
Governor of a State in consequence of a vacancy that had at any time 
occurred in the place of a senator chosen by the people of the State, 
shall be deemed to have been appointed to hold the place until the 
expiration of fourteen days after the beginning of the next session of 
the Parliament of the State that commenced or commences after he was 
appointed and further action under this section shall be taken as if the
 vacancy in the place of the senator chosen by the people of the State 
had occurred after that commencement.</p>
<p>        Subject to the next succeeding paragraph, a senator holding office at the commencement of the <i>Constitutional Alteration (Casual Senate Vacancies)</i>
 1977 who was chosen by the House or Houses of Parliament of a State in 
consequence of a vacancy that had at any time occurred in the place of a
 senator chosen by the people of the State shall be deemed to have been 
chosen to hold office until the expiration of the term of service of the
 senator elected by the people of the State.</p>
<p>        If, at or before the commencement of the <i>Constitution Alteration (Senate</i> Casual Vacancies) 1977, a law to alter the Constitution entitled “<i>Constitutional Alteration (Simultaneous Elections)</i>
 1977″ came into operation, a senator holding office at the commencement
 of that law who was chosen by the House or Houses of Parliament of a 
State in consequence of a vacancy that had at any time occurred in the 
place of a senator chosen by the people of the State shall be deemed to 
have been chosen to hold office:</p>
<p>(a)     if the senator elected by the people of the State had a term 
of service expiring on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine 
hundred and seventy-eight – until the expiration or dissolution of the 
first House of Representatives to expire or be dissolved after that law 
came into operation;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>(b)     if the senator elected by the people of the State had a term 
of service expiring on the thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine 
hundred and eighty-one – until the expiration or dissolution of the 
first House of Representatives to expire or be dissolved after that law 
came into operation; or if there is an earlier dissolution of the 
Senate, until that dissolution.</p>
<p>16. The qualification of a senator shall be the same as those of a member of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>17. The Senate shall, before proceeding to the despatch of any other 
business, choose a senator to be to President of the Senate; and as 
often as the office of President becomes vacant the Senate shall again 
choose a senator to be the President.  The President shall cease to hold
 his office if he ceases to be a senator.  He may be removed from office
 by a vote of the Senate, or he may resign his office or his seat by 
writing addressed to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>18. Before or during any absence of the President, the Senate may choose a senator to perform his duties in his absence.</p>
<p>19. A senator may by writing addressed to the President, or to the 
Governor-General if there is no President or if the President is absent 
from the Commonwealth, resign his place, which thereupon shall become 
vacant.</p>
<p>20. The place of a senator shall become vacant if for two consecutive
 months of any session of the Parliament he, without the permission of 
the Senate, fails to attend the Senate.</p>
<p>21. Whenever a vacancy happens in the Senate, the President, or if 
there is no President or if the President is absent from the 
Commonwealth the Governor-General, shall notify the same to the Governor
 of the State in the representation of which the vacancy has happened.</p>
<p>22. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least
 one-third of the whole number of the senators shall be necessary to 
constitute a meeting of the Senate for the exercise of its powers.</p>
<p>23. Questions arising in the Senate shall be determined by a majority
 of votes, and each senator shall have one vote.  The President shall in
 all cases be entitled to a vote; and when the votes are equal the 
question shall pass in the negative.</p>
<p><strong>Part III – The House of Representatives</strong></p>
<p>24. The House of Representatives shall be composed of members 
directly chosen by the people of the Commonwealth, and the number of 
such members shall be, as nearly as practicable, twice the number of 
senators.  The number of members chosen in the several States shall be 
in proportion to the respective members of their people, and shall, 
until the Parliament otherwise provides, be determined, whenever 
necessary, in the following manner:</p>
<p>(i.)    A quota shall be ascertained by dividing the number of the 
people of the Commonwealth, as shown by the latest statistics of the 
Commonwealth, by twice the number of senators:</p>
<p>(ii.)   The number of members to be chosen in each State shall be 
determined by dividing the number of people of the State, as shown by 
the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, by the quota; and if on such 
division there is a remainder greater than one-half of the quota, one 
more member shall be chosen in the State.  But notwithstanding anything 
in this section, five members at least shall be chosen in each Original 
State.</p>
<p>25. For the purposes of the last section, if by the law of any State 
all persons of any race are disqualified from voting at elections for 
the more numerous House of the Parliament of the State, then, in 
reckoning the number of the people of the State or of the Commonwealth, 
persons of the race resident in that State shall not be counted.</p>
<p>26. Notwithstanding anything in section twenty-four, the number of 
members to be chosen in each State at the first election shall be as 
follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
        New South Wales:- twenty-three;<br>
        Victoria:- twenty;<br>
        Queensland:- eight;<br>
        South Australia :- six;<br>
        Tasmania:- five;
</p></blockquote>
<p>        Provided that if Western Australia is an Original State, the numbers shall be as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>
        New South Wales:- twenty-six;<br>
        Victoria:- twenty-three;<br>
        Queensland:- nine;<br>
        South Australia:- seven;<br>
        Western Australia:- five;<br>
        Tasmania:- five.
</p></blockquote>
<p>27. Subject to this Constitution, the Parliament may make laws for 
increasing or diminishing the number of the members of the House of 
Representatives.</p>
<p>28. Every House of Representatives shall continue for three years 
from the first meeting of the House, and no longer, but may be soon 
dissolved by the Governor-General.</p>
<p>29. Until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the 
Parliament of any State may make laws for determining the divisions in 
each State for which members of the House of Representatives may be 
chosen, and the number of members to be chosen for each division.  A 
division shall not be formed out of parts of different States.</p>
<p>In the absence of other provision each State shall be one electorate.</p>
<p>30. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the qualification of 
electors of members of the House of Representatives shall be in each 
State that which is prescribed by the law of the State as the 
qualification of electors of the more numerous House of Parliament of 
the State; but in the choosing of members each elector shall vote only 
once.</p>
<p>31. Until the parliament otherwise provides, but subject to this 
Constitution, the laws in force in each State for the time being 
relating to elections for the more numerous House of the Parliament of 
the State shall, as nearly as practicable, apply to elections in the 
State of members of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>32. The Governor-General in Council may cause writs to be issued for 
general elections of members of the House of Representatives.  After the
 first general election, the writs shall be issued within ten days from 
the expiry of a House of Representatives or from the proclamation of a 
dissolution thereof.</p>
<p>33. Whenever a vacancy happens in the House of Representatives, the 
Speaker shall issue his writ for the election of a new member, or if 
there is no Speaker or if he is absent from the Commonwealth the 
Governor-General in Council may issue the writ.</p>
<p>34. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the qualifications of a member of the House of Representatives shall be as follows:</p>
<p>(i.)    He must be of the full age of twenty-one years, and must be 
an elector entitled to vote at the election of members of the House of 
Representatives, or a person qualifies to become such elector, and must 
have been for three years at the least a resident within the limits of 
the Commonwealth as existing at the time when he was chosen:</p>
<p>(ii.)   He must be a subject of the Queen, either natural-born or for
 at least five years naturalised under a law of the United Kingdom, or 
of a Colony which has become or becomes a State, or of the Commonwealth,
 or of a State.</p>
<p>35. The House of Representatives shall, before proceeding to the 
despatch of any other business, choose a member to be the Speaker of the
 House, and as often as the office of Speaker becomes vacant the House 
shall again choose a member to be the Speaker.  The Speaker shall cease 
to hold his office if he ceases to be a member.  He may be removed from 
office by a vote of the House, or he may resign his office or his seat 
by writing addressed to the Governor-General.</p>
<p>36. Before or during any absence of the Speaker, the House of 
Representatives may choose a member to perform his duties in his 
absence.</p>
<p>37. A member may by writing addressed to the Speaker, or to the 
Governor-General if there is no Speaker or if the Speaker is absent from
 the Commonwealth, resign his place, which there-upon shall become 
vacant.</p>
<p>38. The place of a member shall become vacant if for two consecutive 
months of any session of the Parliament he, without the permission of 
the House, fails to attend the House.</p>
<p>39. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the presence of at least
 one-third of the whole number of the members of the House of 
Representatives shall be necessary to constitute a meeting of the House 
for the exercise of its powers.</p>
<p>40. Questions arising in the House of Representatives shall be 
determined by a majority of votes other than that of the Speaker.  The 
Speaker shall not vote unless the numbers are equal, and then he shall 
have a casting vote.</p>
<p><strong>Part IV – Both Houses of the Parliament</strong></p>
<p>41. No adult person who has or acquires a right to vote at elections 
for the more numerous House of the Parliament of a State shall, while 
the right continues, be prevented by any law of the Commonwealth from 
voting at elections for either House of the Parliament of the 
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>42. Every senator and every member of the House of Representatives 
shall before taking his seat make and subscribe before the 
Governor-General, or some person authorised by him, an oath or 
affirmation of allegiance in the form set forth in the schedule to this 
Constitution.</p>
<p>43. A member of either House of Parliament shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a member of the other House.</p>
<p>44. Any person who</p>
<p>(i.)    Is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or 
adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled 
to the rights &amp; privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign 
power: or</p>
<p>(ii.)   Is attained of treason, or has been convicted and is under 
sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under 
the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year 
or longer: or</p>
<p>(iii.)  Is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent: or</p>
<p>(iv.)   Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension 
payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of 
the Commonwealth: or</p>
<p>(v.)    Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any 
agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a
 member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company 
consisting of more than twenty-five persons:</p>
<p>        shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator
 or a member of the House of Representatives.  But sub-section iv. does 
not apply to the office of any of the Queen’s Ministers of State for the
 Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen’s Ministers for a State, or to the
 receipt of pay, half pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or 
member of the Queen’s navy or army, or to the receipt of pay as an 
officer or member of the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth by
 any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>45. If a senator or member of the House of Representatives</p>
<p>(i.)    Becomes subject to any of the disabilities mentioned in the last preceding section: or</p>
<p>(ii.)   Takes the benefit, whether by assignment, composition, or 
otherwise, of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors: or</p>
<p>(iii.)  Directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or 
honorarium for services rendered to the Commonwealth, or for services 
rendered in the Parliament to any person or State:</p>
<p>        his place shall thereupon become vacant.</p>
<p>46. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any person declared by 
this Constitution to be incapable of sitting as a senator or as a member
 of the House of Representatives shall, for every day on which he so 
sits, be liable to pay the sum of one hundred pounds to any person who 
sues for it in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>47. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any question respecting 
the qualification of a senator or member of the House or 
Representatives, or respecting a vacancy in either House of the 
Parliament, and any question of a disputed election to either House, 
shall be determined by the House in which the question arises.</p>
<p>48. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, each senator and each 
member of the House of Representatives shall receive an allowance of 
four hundred pounds a year, to be reckoned from the day on which he 
takes his seat.</p>
<p>49. The powers, privileges, and immunities of the Senate and of the 
House of Representatives, and of the members and the committees of each 
House, shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until 
declared shall be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United
 Kingdom, and of its members and committees, at the establishment of the
 Commonwealth.</p>
<p>50. Each House of the Parliament may make rules and orders with respect to</p>
<p>(i.)    The mode in which its powers, privileges, and immunities may be exercised and upheld:</p>
<p>(ii.)   The order and conduct of its business and proceedings either separately or jointly with the other House.</p>

<p>56. A vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of 
revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the

Representatives will not agree, the Governor-General may convene a joint

therein by one House and not agreed to by the other, and any such 
amendments which are affirmed by an absolute majority of the total 
number of the members of the Senate and House of Representatives shall 
be taken to have been carried, and if the proposed law, with the 
amendments, if any, so carried is affirmed by an absolute majority of 
the total number of the members of the Senate and House of 
Representatives, it shall be taken to have been duly passed by Houses of
 the Parliament, and shall be presented to the Governor-General for the 
Queen’s assent.</p>
<p>58. When a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is 
presented to the Governor-General for the Queen’s assent, he shall

presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may
 recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation.</p>
<p>59. The Queen may disallow any law within one year from the 
Governor-General’s assent, and such disallowance on being made known by

Parliament, or by Proclamation, shall annul the law from the day when

<p>61. The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen

representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this 
Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>62. There shall be a Federal Executive Council to advise the 
Governor-General in the government of the Commonwealth, and the members 
of the Council shall be chosen and summoned by the Governor-General and 
sworn as Executive Councillors, and shall hold office during his 
pleasure.</p>
<p>63. The provisions of this Constitution referring to the 
Governor-General in Council shall be construed as referring to the 
Governor-General acting with the advice of the Federal Executive 
Council.</p>
<p>64. The Governor-General may appoint officers to administer such 
departments of State of the Commonwealth as the Governor-General in 
Council may establish.</p>
<p>Such officers shall hold office during he pleasure of the 
Governor-General. They shall be members of the Federal Executive 
Council, and shall be the Queen’s Ministers of State for the 
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>After the first general election no Minister of State shall hold 
office for a longer period than three months unless he is or becomes a 
senator or a member of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>65. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the Ministers of the 
State shall not exceed seven in number, and shall hold such offices as 
the Parliament prescribes, or, in the absence of provision, as the 
Governor- General directs.</p>
<p>66. There shall be payable to the Queen, out of the Consolidated 
Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth, for the salaries of the Ministers of 
State, an annual sum which, until the Parliament otherwise provides, 
shall not exceed twelve thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>67. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the appointment and 
removal of all other officers of the Executive Government of the 
Commonwealth shall be vested in the Governor-General in Council, unless 
the appointment is delegated by the Governor-General in Council or by a 
law of the Commonwealth to some other authority.</p>
<p>68. The command in chief of the naval and military forces of the 
Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen’s 
representative.</p>
<p>69. On a date or dates to be proclaimed by the Governor-General after
 the establishment of the Commonwealth the following departments of the 
public service in each State shall become transferred to the 
Commonwealth:</p>
<blockquote><p>
        Posts, telegraphs, and telephones:<br>
        Naval and military defence:<br>
        Lighthouses, lightships, beacons, and buoys:<br>
        Quarantine.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But the departments of customs and of excise in each State shall become transferred to the Commonwealth on its establishment.</p>
<p>70. In respect of matters which, under this Constitution, pass to the
 Executive Government of the Commonwealth, all powers and functions 
which at the establishment of the Commonwealth are vested in the 
Governor of a Colony, or in the Governor of a Colony with the advice of 
his Executive Council, or in any authority of a Colony, shall vest in 
the Governor-General, or in the Governor-General in Council, or in the 
authority exercising similar powers under the Commonwealth, as the case 
requires.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ch3">Chapter III</a> – The Judicature</strong></p>
<p>71. The judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a 
Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, and in 
such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other 
courts as it invests with federal jurisdiction.  The High Court shall 
consist of a Chief Justice, and so many other Justices, not less than 
two, as the Parliament prescribes.</p>
<p>72. The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament</p>
<p>(i.)    Shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council:</p>
<p>(ii.)   Shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in 
Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same 
session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour 
or incapacity:</p>
<p>(iii.)  Shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; 
but the remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance in
 office.</p>
<p>        The appointment of a Justice of the High Court shall be for a
 term expiring upon his attaining the age of seventy years, and a person
 shall not be appointed as a Justice of the High Court if he has 
attained that age.</p>
<p>        The appointment of a Justice of a court created by the 
Parliament shall be for a term expiring upon his attaining the age that 
is, at the time of his appointment, the maximum age for Justices of that
 court and a person shall not be appointed as a Justice of such a court 
if he has attained the age that is for the time being the maximum age 
for Justices of that court.</p>
<p>        Subject to this section, the maximum age for Justices of any court created by the Parliament is seventy years.</p>
<p>        The Parliament may make a law fixing an age that is less than
 seventy years as the maximum age for Justices of a court created by the
 Parliament and may at any time repeal or amend such a law, but any such
 repeal or amendment does not affect the term of office of a Justice 
under an appointment made before the repeal or amendment.</p>
<p>        A Justice of the High Court or of a court created by the 
Parliament may resign his office by writing under his hand delivered to 
the Governor-General.</p>
<p>        Nothing in the provisions added to this section by the <i>Constitution</i>
 Alteration (Retirement of Judges) 1977 affects the continuance of a 
person in office as a Justice of a court under an appointment made 
before the commencement of those provisions.</p>
<p>        A reference in this section to the appointment of a Justice 
of the High Court or of a court created by the Parliament shall be read 
as including a reference to the appointment of a person who holds office
 as a Justice of the High Court or of a court created by the Parliament 
to another office of Justice of the same court having a different status
 or designation.</p>
<p>73. The High Court shall have jurisdiction, with such exceptions and 
subject to such regulations as the Parliament prescribes, to hear and 
determine appeals from all judgments, decrees, orders, and sentences</p>
<p>(i.)    Of any Justice or Justices exercising the original jurisdiction of the High Court:</p>
<p>(ii.)   Of any other federal court, or court exercising federal 
jurisdiction; or of the Supreme Court of any State, or of any other 
court of any State from which at the establishment of the Commonwealth 
an appeal lies to the Queen in Council:</p>
<p>(iii.)  Of the Inter-State Commission, but as to questions of law only:</p>
<p>        and the judgment of the High Court in all such cases shall be final and conclusive.</p>
<p>        But no exception or regulation prescribed by the Parliament 
shall prevent the High Court from hearing and determining any appeal 
from the Supreme Court of a State in any matter in which at the 
establishment of the Commonwealth an appeal lies from such Supreme Court
 to the Queen in Council.</p>
<p>        Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the conditions of 
and restrictions on appeals to the Queen in Council from the Supreme 
Courts of the several States shall be applicable to appeals from them to
 the High Court.</p>
<p>74. No appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council from a 
decision of the High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to 
the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and
 those of any State or States, or as to the limits inter se of the 
Constitutional powers of any two or more States, unless the High Court 
shall certify that the Question is one which ought to be determined by 
Her Majesty in Council.</p>
<p>        The High Court may so certify if satisfied that for any 
special reason the certificate should be granted, and thereupon an 
appeal shall lie to Her Majesty in Council on the question without 
further leave.</p>
<p>        Except as provided in this section, this Constitution shall 
not impair any right which the Queen may be please to exercise by virtue
 of Her Royal prerogative to grant special leave of appeal from the High
 Court to Her Majesty in Council.  The Parliament may make laws limiting
 the matters in which leave may be asked, but proposed laws containing 
any such limitations shall be reserved by the Governor-General for Her 
Majesty’s pleasure.</p>
<p>75. In all matters</p>
<p>(i.)    Arising under any treaty:</p>
<p>(ii.)   Affecting consuls or other representatives of other countries:</p>
<p>(iii.)  In which the Commonwealth, or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party:</p>
<p>(iv.)   Between States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State:</p>
<p>(v.)    In which a writ of Mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth:</p>
<p>        the High Court shall have original jurisdiction.</p>
<p>76. The Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter</p>
<p>        (i.)    Arising under this Constitution, or involving its interpretation:</p>
<p>        (ii.)   Arising under any laws made by the Parliaments:</p>
<p>        (iii.)  Of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction:</p>
<p>        (iv.)   Relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States.</p>
<p>77. With respect to any of the matters mentioned in the last two sections the Parliament may make laws</p>
<p>(i.)    Defining the jurisdiction of any federal court other than the High Court:</p>
<p>(ii.)   Defining the extent to which the jurisdiction of any federal 
court shall be exclusive of that which belongs to or is invested in the 
courts of the States:</p>
<p>(iii.)  Investing any court of a State with federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>78. The Parliament may make laws conferring rights to proceed against
 the Commonwealth or a State in respect of matters within the limits of 
the judicial power.</p>
<p>79. The federal jurisdiction of any court may be exercised by such number of judges as the Parliament prescribes.</p>
<p>80. The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the 
Commonwealth shall be by jury, and every such trial shall be held in the
 State where the offence was committed, and if the offence was not 
committed within any State the trial shall be held at such place or 
places as the Parliament prescribes.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ch4">Chapter IV</a> – Finance And Trade</strong>&gt;</p>
<p>81. All revenues or moneys raised or received by the Executive 
Government of the Commonwealth shall form one Consolidated Revenue Fund,
 to be appropriated for the purposes of the Commonwealth in the manner 
and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by this Constitution.</p>
<p>82. The costs, charges, and expenses incident to the collection, 
management, and receipt of the Consolidated Revenue Fund shall form the 
first charge thereon; and the revenue of the Commonwealth shall in the 
first instance be applied to the payment of the expenditure of the 
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>83. No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the Commonwealth except under appropriation made by law.</p>
<p>        But until the expiration of one month after the first meeting
 of the Parliament the Governor-General in Council may draw from the 
Treasury and expend such moneys as may be necessary for the maintenance 
of any department transferred to the Commonwealth and for the holding of
 the first elections for the Parliament.</p>
<p>84. When any department of the public service of a State becomes 
transferred to the Commonwealth, all officers of the department shall 
become subject to the control of the Executive Government of the 
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>        Any such officer who is not retained in the service of the 
Commonwealth shall, unless he is appointed to some other office of equal
 emolument in the public service of the State, be entitled to receive 
from the State any pension, gratuity, or other compensation, payable 
under the law of the State on the abolition of his office.</p>
<p>        Any such officer who is retained in the service of the 
Commonwealth shall preserve all his existing and accruing rights, and 
shall be entitled to retire from office at the time, and on the pension 
or retiring allowance, which would be permitted by the law of the State 
if his service with the Commonwealth were a continuation of his service 
with the State.  Such pension or retiring allowance shall be paid to him
 by the Commonwealth; but the State shall pay to the Commonwealth a part
 thereof, to be calculated on the proportion which his term of service 
with the State bears to his whole term of service, and for the purpose 
of the calculation his salary shall be taken to be that paid to him by 
the State at the time of the transfer.</p>
<p>        Any officer who is, at the establishment of the Commonwealth,
 in the public service of a State, and who is, by consent of the 
Governor of the State with the advice of the Executive Council thereof, 
transferred to the public service of the Commonwealth, shall have the 
same rights as if he had been an officer of a department transferred to 
the Commonwealth and were retained in the service of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>85. When any departments of the public service of a State is transferred to the Commonwealth</p>
<p>(i.)    All property of the State of any kind, used exclusively in 
connection with the department, shall become vested in the Commonwealth;
 but, in the case of the departments controlling customs and excise and 
bounties, for such time only as the Governor-General in Council may 
declare to be necessary:</p>
<p>(ii.)   The Commonwealth may acquire any property of the State, of 
any kind used, but not exclusively used in connection with the 
department; the value thereof shall, if no agreement can be made, be 
ascertained in, as nearly as may be, the manner in which the value of 
land, or of an interest in land, taken by the State for public purposes 
is ascertained under the law of the State in force at the establishment 
of the Commonwealth:</p>
<p>(iii.)  The Commonwealth shall compensate the State for the value of 
any property passing to the Commonwealth under this section; if no 
agreement can be made as to the mode of compensation, it shall be 
determined under laws to be made by the Parliament:</p>
<p>(iv.)   The Commonwealth shall, at the date of the transfer, assume 
the current obligations of the State in respect of the department 
transferred.</p>
<p>86. On the establishment of the Commonwealth, the collection and 
control of duties of customs and of excise, and the control of the 
payment of bounties, shall pass to the Executive Government of the 
Commonwealth.</p>
<p>87. During a period of ten years after the establishment of the 
Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of 
the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs and of excise
 not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth 
towards its expenditure.</p>
<p>        The balance shall, in accordance with the Constitution, be 
paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest 
on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>88. Uniform duties of customs shall be imposed within two years after the establishment of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>89. Until the imposition of uniform duties of custom</p>
<p>(i.)    The Commonwealth shall credit to each State the revenues collected therein by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>(ii.)   The Commonwealth shall debit to each State (a) The 
expenditure therein of the Commonwealth incurred solely for the 
maintenance or continuance, as at the time of transfer, of any 
department transferred from the State to the Commonwealth; (b) The 
proportion of the State, according to the number of its people, in the 
other expenditure of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>(iii.)  The Commonwealth shall pay to each State month by month the balance (if any) in favour of the State.</p>
<p>90. On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the 
Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant 
bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.</p>
<p>        On the imposition of uniform duties of customs all laws of 
the several States imposing duties of customs or of excise, or offering 
bounties on the production or export of goods, shall cease to have 
effect, but any grant of or agreement for any such bounty lawfully made 
by or under the authority of the Government of any State shall be taken 
to be good if made before the thirtieth day of June, One thousand eight 
hundred and ninety eight, and not otherwise.</p>
<p>91. Nothing in this Constitution prohibits a State from granting any 
aid to or bounty on mining for gold, silver, or other metals, not from 
granting, with the consent of both Houses of the Parliament of the 
Commonwealth expressed by resolution, any aid to or bounty on the 
production or export of goods.</p>
<p>92. On the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, 
and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage 
or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely free.</p>
<p>        But notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, goods 
imported before the imposition of uniform duties of customs into any 
State, or into any Colony which, whilst the goods remain therein, 
becomes a State, shall, on thence passing into another State within two 
years after the imposition of such duties, be liable to any duty 
chargeable on the importation of such goods into the Commonwealth, less 
any duty paid in respect of the goods on their importation.</p>
<p>93. During the first five years after the imposition of uniform 
duties of customs, and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise 
provides</p>
<p>(i.)    The duties of customs chargeable on goods imported into a 
State and afterwards passing into another State for consumption, and the
 duties of excise paid on goods produced or manufactured in a State and 
afterwards passing into another State for consumption, shall be taken to
 have been collected not in the former but in the latter State:</p>
<p>(ii.)   Subject to the last subsection, the Commonwealth shall credit
 revenue, debit expenditure, and pay balances to the several States as 
prescribed for the period preceding the imposition of uniform duties of 
customs.</p>
<p>94. After five years from the imposition of uniform duties of 
customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for
 the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the
 Commonwealth.</p>
<p>95. Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the Parliament of 
the State of Western Australia, if that State be an Original State, may,
 during the first five years after the imposition of uniform duties of 
customs, impose duties of customs on goods passing into that State and 
not originally imported from beyond the limits of the Commonwealth; and 
such duties shall be collected by the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>        But any duty so imposed on any goods shall not exceed during 
the first of such years the duty chargeable on the goods under the law 
of Western Australia in force at the imposition of uniform duties, and 
shall not exceed during the second, third, fourth, and fifth of such 
years respectively, four-fifths, two-fifth, and one-fifth of such latter
 duty, and all duties imposed under this section shall cease at the 
expiration of the fifth year after the imposition of uniform duties.</p>
<p>        If at any time during the five years the duty on any goods 
under this section is higher than the duty imposed by the Commonwealth 
on the importation of the like goods, then such higher duty shall be 
collected on the goods when imported into Western Australia from beyond 
the limits of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>96. During a period of ten years after the establishment of the 
Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, the
 Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms 
and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.</p>
<p>97. Until the Parliament otherwise provides, the laws in force in any
 Colony which has become or becomes a State with respect to the receipt 
of revenue and the expenditure of money on account of the Government of 
the Colony, and the review and audit of such receipt and expenditure, 
shall apply to the receipt of revenue and the expenditure of money on 
account of the Commonwealth in the State in the same manner as if the 
Commonwealth, or the Government or an officer of the Commonwealth were 
mentioned whenever the Colony, or the Government or an officer of the 
Colony, is mentioned.</p>
<p>98. The power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade 
and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the 
property of any State.</p>
<p>99. The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, 
commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof 
over another State or any part thereof.</p>
<p>100.        The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of 
trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State or of the residents 
therein to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation 
or irrigation.</p>
<p>101.        There shall be an Inter-State Commission, with such 
powers of adjudication and administration as the Parliament deems 
necessary for the execution and maintenance, within the Commonwealth, of
 the provisions of this Constitution relating to trade and commerce, and
 of all laws made thereunder.</p>
<p>102.        The Parliament may by any law with respect to trade or 
commerce forbid, as to railways, any preference or discrimination by any
 State, or by any authority constituted under a State, if such 
preference or discrimination is undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any
 State; due regard being had to the financial responsibilities incurred 
by any State in connection with the<br>
construction and maintenance of its railways.  But no preference or 
discrimination shall, within the meaning of this section, be taken to be
 undue and unreasonable, or unjust to any State, unless so adjudged by 
the Inter-State Commission.</p>
<p>103.        The members of the Inter-State Commission</p>
<p>(i.)    Shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council:</p>
<p>(ii.)   Shall hold office for seven years, but may be removed within 
that time by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both 
Houses of the Parliament in the same session praying for such removal on
 the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity:</p>
<p>(iii.)  Shall receive such remuneration as the Parliament may fix; 
but such remuneration shall not be diminished during their continuance 
in office.</p>
<p>104.        Nothing in this Constitution shall render unlawful any 
rate for the carriage of goods upon a railway, the property of a State, 
if the rate is deemed by the Inter-State Commission to be necessary for 
the development of the territory of the State, and if the rate applies 
equally to goods within the State and to goods passing into the State 
from other States.</p>
<p>105.        The Parliament may take over from the States their public
 debts, or a proportion thereof according to the respective numbers of 
their people as shown by the latest statistics of the Commonwealth, and 
may convert, renew, or consolidate such debts, or any part thereof; ad 
the States shall indemnify the Commonwealth in respect of the debts 
taken over, and thereafter the interest payable in respect of the debts 
shall be deducted and retained from the portions of the surplus revenue 
of the Commonwealth payable to the several States, or if such surplus is
 insufficient, or if there is no surplus, then the deficiency or the 
whole amount shall be paid by the several States.</p>
<p>105A.  (1) The Commonwealth may make agreements with the States with respect to the public debts of the States, including</p>
<p>(a)     the taking over of such debts by the Commonwealth;</p>
<p>(b)     the management of such debts;</p>
<p>(c)     the paying of interest and the provision and management of sinking funds in respect of such debts;</p>
<p>(d)     the consolidation, renewal, conversion, and redemption of such debts;</p>
<p>(e)     the indemnification of the Commonwealth by the States in respect of debts taken over by the Commonwealth; and</p>
<p>(f)     the borrowing of money by the States or by the Commonwealth, or by the Commonwealth for the States.</p>
<p>(2)     The Parliament may make laws for validating any such agreement made before the commencement of this section.</p>
<p>(3)     The Parliament may make laws for the carrying out by the parties of any such agreement.</p>
<p>(4)     Any such agreement may be varied or rescinded by the parties therein.</p>
<p>(5)     Every such agreement and any such variation thereof shall be 
binding upon the Commonwealth and the States parties thereto 
notwithstanding anything contained in this Constitution or the 
Constitution of the several States or in any law of the Parliament of 
the Commonwealth or of any State.</p>
<p>(6)     The powers conferred by this section shall not be construed 
as being limited in any way by the provision of section one hundred and 
five of this Constitution.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ch5">Chapter V</a> – The States</strong></p>
<p>106.        The Constitution of each State of the Commonwealth shall,
 subject to this Constitution, continue as at the establishment of the 
Commonwealth, or as at the admission of establishment of the State, as 
the case may be, until altered in accordance with the Constitution of 
the State.</p>
<p>107.        Every power of the Parliament of a Colony which has 
become or becomes a State, shall, unless it is by this Constitution 
exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn 
from the Parliament of the State, continue as at the establishment of 
the Commonwealth, or as at the admission or establishment of the State, 
as the case may be.</p>
<p>108.        Every law in force in a Colony which has become or 
becomes a State, and relating to any matter within the powers of the 
Parliament of the Commonwealth shall, subject to this Constitution, 
continue in force in the State; and, until provision is made in that 
behalf by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the Parliament of the 
State shall have such powers of alteration and of repeal in respect of 
any such law as the Parliament of the Colony had until the Colony became
 a State.</p>
<p>109.        When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the 
Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the 
extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.</p>
<p>110.        The provisions of this Constitution relating to the 
Governor of a State extend and apply to the Governor for the time being 
of the State, or other chief executive officer or administrator of the 
government of the State.</p>
<p>111.        The Parliament of a State may surrender any part of the 
State to the Commonwealth; and upon such surrender, and the acceptance 
thereof by the Commonwealth, such part of the State shall become subject
 to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>112.        After uniform duties of customs have been imposed, a 
State may levy on imports, or on goods passing into or out of the State 
such charges as my be necessary for executing the inspection laws of the
 State; but the net produce of all charges so levied shall be for the 
use of the Commonwealth; and any such inspection laws may be annulled by
 the Parliament of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>113.        All fermented, distilled, or other intoxicating liquids 
passing into any State or remaining therein for use, consumption, sale, 
or storage, shall be subject to the laws of the State as if such liquids
 had been produced in the State.</p>
<p>114.        A State shall not, without the consent of the Parliament 
of the Commonwealth, raise or maintain any naval or military force, or 
impose any tax on property of any kind belonging to the Commonwealth, 
not shall the Commonwealth impose any tax on property of any kind 
belonging to a State.</p>
<p>115.        A State shall not coin money, nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts.</p>
<p>116.        The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing 
any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for 
prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test 
shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust 
under the Commonwealth.</p>
<p>117.        A subject of the Queen, resident in any State, shall not 
be subject to any other State to any disability or discrimination which 
would not be equally applicable to him if he were a subject of the Queen
 resident in such other State.</p>
<p>118.        Full faith and credit shall be given, throughout the 
Commonwealth to the laws, the public Acts and records, and the judicial 
proceeding of every State.</p>
<p>119.        The Commonwealth shall protect every State against the 
invasion and, on the application of the Executive Government of the 
State, against domestic violence.</p>
<p>120.        Every State shall make provisions for the detention in 
its prisons of persons accused or convicted of offences against the laws
 of the Commonwealth, and for the punishment of persons convicted of 
such offences, and the Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws to 
give effects to this provision.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ch6">Chapter VI</a> – New States</strong></p>
<p>121.        The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish
 new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose
 such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in 
either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit.</p>
<p>122.        The Parliament may make laws for the government of any 
territory surrendered by any State to and accepted by the Commonwealth, 
or of any territory placed by the Queen under the authority of an 
accepted by the Commonwealth, and may allow the representation of such 
territory in either House of the Parliament to the extent and on the 
terms which it thinks fit.</p>
<p>123.        The Parliament of the Commonwealth may, with the consent 
of the Parliament of a State, and the approval of the majority of the 
electors of the State voting upon the question, increase, diminish, or 
otherwise alter the limits of the State, upon such terms and conditions 
as may be agreed on, and may, with the like consent, make provision 
respecting the effect and operation of any increase or diminution or 
alteration of territory in relation to any State affected.</p>
<p>124.        A new State may be formed by separation of territory from
 a State, but only with the consent of the Parliament thereof, and a new
 State may be formed by the union of two or more States or parts of 
States, but only with the consent of the Parliaments of the States 
affected.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ch7">Chapter VII</a> – Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>125.        The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be 
determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall 
have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, and shall be 
vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of 
New South Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from 
Sydney.</p>
<p>        Such territory shall contain an area of not less than one 
hundred square miles, and such portion thereof as shall consist of Crown
 lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any payment 
therefor.  The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the 
seat of Government.</p>
<p>126.        The Queen may authorise the Governor-General to appoint 
any person, or any persons jointly or severally, to be his deputy or 
deputies within any part of the Commonwealth, and in that capacity to 
exercise during the pleasure of the Governor-General as he thinks fit to
 assign to such deputy or deputies, subject to any limitations expressed
 or directions given by the Queen; but the appointment of such deputy or
 deputies shall not affect the exercise by the Governor-General himself 
of any power or function.</p>
<p><strong><a name="ch8">Chapter VIII</a> – Alteration Of The Constitution</strong></p>
<p>128.        This Constitution shall not be altered except in the following manner:</p>
<p>        The proposed law for the alteration thereof must be passed by
 an absolute majority of each House of the Parliament, and not less than
 two nor more than six months after its passage through both Houses the 
proposed law shall be submitted in each State and Territory to the 
electors qualified to vote for the election of members of the House of 
Representatives.</p>
<p>        But if either House passes any such proposed law by an 
absolute majority, and the other House rejects or fails to pass it, or 
passes it with any amendments to which the first-mentioned House will 
not agree, and if after an interval of three months the first-mentioned 
House in the same or the next session again passes the proposed law by 
an absolute majority with or without any amendment which has been made 
or agreed to by the other House, and such other House rejects or fails 
to pass it or passes it with any amendment to which the first-mentioned 
House will not agree, the Governor-General may submit the proposed law 
as last proposed by the first-mentioned House, and either with or 
without any amendments subsequently agreed to by both Houses, to the 
electors in each State and Territory qualified to vote for the election 
of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>        When a proposed law is submitted to the electors the vote 
shall be taken in such manner as the Parliament prescribes.  But until 
the qualification of electors of members of the House of Representatives
 becomes uniform throughout the Commonwealth, only one-half the electors
 voting for and against the proposed law shall be counted in any State 
in which adult suffrage prevails.</p>
<p>        And if in a majority of the States a majority of the electors
 voting approve the proposed law, and if a majority of all the electors 
voting also approve the proposed law, it shall be presented to the 
Governor-General for the Queen’s assent.</p>
<p>        No alteration diminishing the proportionate representation of
 any State in either House of the Parliament, or the minimum number of 
representatives of a State in the House of Representative, in 
increasing, diminishing, or otherwise altering the limits of the State, 
or in any manner affecting the provisions of the Constitution in 
relation thereto, shall become law unless the majority of the electors 
voting in that State approve the proposed law.</p>
<p>        In this section “Territory” means any territory referred to 
in section one hundred and twenty-two of this Constitution in respect of
 which there is in force a law allowing its representation in the House 
of Representatives.</p>
